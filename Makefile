# The gate against a FROZEN CHECKOUT of HEAD, rather than the working tree.
#
# WHY IT IS WORTH A TARGET. `make check` reads the directory, and a guard armed
# by hand in another session — break it, watch it fail, restore it — is invisible
# to a run whose staging step lands inside that window. It cost three diagnoses
# in one day: a failing association_test, a failing associationcaps_test, and a red
# kourtv2 suite in check-storage. None reproduced; all three were somebody's arm
# caught mid-flight. repolock closes this when the mutator announces itself
# (`repolock.py hold -- ...`); this closes it when nobody does, by testing a
# COMMIT instead of a directory. It is also what a reviewer actually wants to
# know: does the thing I would pull pass.
#
# THE PATH IS NOT ARBITRARY, and this is the part that is easy to get wrong.
# go.mod carries `replace ... => ../../gnolang/gno`, which resolves only from a
# sibling directory inside the gopath. The first draft of this put the worktree
# in /tmp, where `go vet` died on the missing replacement directory before a
# single check ran — five lines of output, none of them about this repo.
#
# `make`, NOT `$(MAKE)`, and that is not a style choice. GNU make EXECUTES a
# recipe line containing $(MAKE) even under `make -n`, deliberately, so that a
# sub-make can dry-run too. The cleanup lives on that same line — so `make -n
# check-frozen`, which anybody would reasonably type first to see what this does,
# ran `git worktree remove` for real. It deleted the worktree out from under a
# gate that was running inside it, and the run died with
#
#     can't open file 'scripts/check-nontransferable.py': No such file
#
# blaming a guard that had done nothing wrong. A dry run must not be able to
# delete a directory. Plain `make` is not special-cased, so -n only prints it.
# The cost is that MAKEFLAGS do not propagate to the inner run, which this target
# does not need.
#
# A KILLED RUN LEAVES THE WORKTREE. The cleanup is the last line of the recipe,
# so a SIGTERM part-way through realm-test skips it — which is not
# hypothetical, it happened on the first long run of this target. The recipe
# therefore removes the path BEFORE it creates one, the same posture
# scripts/gnoroot.py takes about leaked shadow roots: the next run cleans up
# after the last, rather than pretending the last one always could. What a
# killed run leaves is a checkout of a commit in the gopath, which is inert
# but looks enough like a real one to confuse — `git worktree list` names it.
# ONE AT A TIME, unlike scripts/gnoroot.py, which keys its shadow roots by pid
# so two runners never share one. A make variable cannot reach the recipe's pid
# as cleanly, and the cost of the simpler thing is only that two concurrent
# `check-frozen` runs would fight over the same directory — noisily, not
# silently, since the second `git worktree add` refuses a path that exists.

	@# asks whether it still fails when its OWN detection stops matching -- and
	@# two of them did not: check-tdz and check-mark-font each scanned nothing,
	@# found nothing and exited 0 with their pattern blinded. One second, runs
	@# every guard against a blinded COPY and never writes to the tree.
	python3 scripts/check-guards-blind.py
	@# The browser-side twin, and it says so in its own header: a guard that is
	@# not registered is not a guard, and a browser check no runner runs is the
	@# same hole. It was in NO target — measured: `grep -rn
	@# check-browser-checks-registered Makefile scripts/` found nothing — while
	@# returning rc=1, so it policed nothing and nobody heard it fail. It is
	@# static (no puppeteer, no page load), which is the whole reason it exists
	@# separately from web-visual, and `guards` is already in `check`.
	python3 scripts/check-browser-checks-registered.py
	@# One block is five seconds, said in three languages that cannot import it
	@# from each other, and two kourtv2 deadlines written once in blocks and once
	@# in seconds. The realm reads whichever half a record carries, so a drift
	@# does not fail — it quietly gives an old record and a new one different
	@# windows. Static, no toolchain, so it belongs here.
	python3 scripts/check-block-time.py
	@# What the mutation corpus covers is a claim about the IMPORT GRAPH, and

# The other half of that check. `guards` asks whether each guard is REGISTERED in
# selftest-checks.py; this asks whether each control arm's PLANT still applies. A
# rotted anchor makes the arm a no-op — the guard runs against an unmodified tree
# and is reported SILENT — and until now only selftest could see that, which means
# only when somebody remembered to run it. Static, touches no file, so it belongs
# in `check` for the same reason check-guards-armed does.

# The overlay's own regression suite. It lived in a scratch directory until r31,

# rounds by a rename, and ten more by one commit that was reported green because
# only four were run by hand. Skips cleanly with no node, like realm-test does
# with no gno; REQUIRE_NODE=1 makes a missing node a failure instead.
# The browser half: real layout measurement, needs puppeteer. NOT in `check` —
# it wants a headless Chrome, and the gate must not. It caught a grid rule that
# put the whole page body below the sidebar, which reading the CSS did not.
#
# EVERY HARNESS DRIVES A REAL BROWSER, so none is cheap: SEVENTEEN of them, about

# The realms' own tests, plus the three guards that hold the documentation to

#
# They have to run from inside GNOROOT/examples: the realms resolve their
# imports from the examples tree, and gno test will not find a sibling package
# any other way. The staged copies are removed afterwards.
#
# That tree used to be SHARED — one $GNOROOT for every runner and every worktree,
# each ending in an rm -rf of a directory the others might be reading. This now
# builds its own GNOROOT instead (scripts/gnoroot.py): symlinks to everything
# except a private copy of examples/, named after this SHELL's pid ($$) so two
# runs in one checkout do not share it either. Import paths are untouched, so the
# code under test is byte-identical to the code that is committed.
#
# EVERY CHECK AND EVERY PACKAGE RUNS; the target fails at the END. It used to be
# a chain of `|| exit 1`, and the consequence was not a tidier log: with
# check-storage.py failing on one filetest's ceiling, this target exited at that
# line and NEVER REACHED `gno test` — so the whole realm unit suite, seven p/
# packages and five r/ realms, silently stopped running while the target went on
# reporting a familiar red for a familiar reason. MEASURED: the target was rc=2
# with the ceiling breach; running `gno test .` for kourtv2 by hand against the
# same staged root was rc=0 in 17s, coverage the gate had not been giving for as
# long as that ceiling had been over.
#
# So the independent audits accumulate into rc, and so do the test loops -- one
# failing package no longer hides the eleven behind it. What still hard-fails is
# only what the rest cannot run without: the repo lock (do not stage into a tree
# somebody else is rewriting), the shadow GNOROOT, and the staging copies.
#
# THE NINE AUDITS ARE SPELLED OUT, NOT LOOPED. They were briefly a `for chk in
# citations docnumbers ...` loop building `scripts/check-$$chk.py`, which is
# tidier and wrong here: it makes `grep -rn check-storage.py Makefile` find
# nothing. This repo's guards are static readers of literal names --
# check-guards-armed.py exists because guards landed unwired -- and an audit
# asking "what runs check-storage?" is exactly the question that must not come

# ran before it. Slow — each suite once per test — hence its own target.

	python3 scripts/check-isolation.py

# Break the MONEY PATH on purpose and check the suite objects: every row in
# scripts/mutations-kourtv2.json applied and reverted in turn, over kourtv2 and the
# packages it imports. Run this before any money-path change — a green suite proves
# nothing on its own, since it passes against correct code and against code whose
# guard you deleted.
#
# Sharded across concurrent runners (scripts/mutate-parallel.py), which is safe
# because each builds its own GNOROOT and mutates only its staged copy.
#
# THE COST, stated structurally rather than as a number, because the number was
# wrong within months of being written (this comment said "56 named mutations" and
# "~2.5 minutes" when the corpus had reached 865 rows):
#
#     wall time ~= rows / shards * runtime of the mutated package's suite
#
# Staging is noise beside it — 0.03s against seconds for a suite — so the cost is
# irreducibly ONE SUITE RUN PER ROW.
#
# To get the dominant term, TIME THE SUITE rather than trusting a figure in here:
#
#     root=$(python3 scripts/gnoroot.py build --label t --pid $$)
#     ...stage as realm-test does, then: GNOROOT=$root gno test .   # in r/kourtv2
#
# and time it on an IDLE machine. Three readings of the same kourtv2 suite, all
# real: 3.67s when an earlier version of this comment was written, ~8s idle today,
# and ~34s while another session's `make isolation-test` ran alongside. The middle
# one is the suite's actual growth; the last is contention, and it is 4x. That
# spread is why the recipe is here and the digit is not. Two consequences before
# you either wait on this target or lengthen a test:
#
#   * Most rows target kourtv2, so each one pays the WHOLE kourtv2 suite.
#     Lengthening one shared test there multiplies across all of them.
#   * A wall time measured while anything else heavy is running (another session's
#     `make isolation-test`, say) measures the contention, not this target. Check
#     `pgrep -f 'gno test|check-isolation|mutate'` before believing a duration.
#
# The output is every row plus ONE verdict; shard boundaries are not shown. Nothing
# is printed until every shard has finished, because the parent collects each
# shard's stdout with subprocess.run — so a quiet log is not a stalled run. To see
# whether it is alive, watch the `gno test` children cycle.
#
# Exists as a target because the batch is otherwise invisible: mutate.py was in this repo
# for the whole of the v0.51-v0.62 work and went unused because nothing pointed at it,
# so every guard was mutated by hand instead.
#
# An interrupted run needs nothing from you. Mutations are applied to the STAGED COPY in
# the run's own shadow GNOROOT, never to the repo, so a killed run cannot leave one in the
# source — which also means several runs may go at once. What it leaves behind is a
# directory in the system temp named after a pid that no longer exists, and the next run
# builds its own.
mutate:

# THE GAPS ARE CLAIMS, SO RUN THEM. Every row in the KNOWN-GAPS file asserts that no test
# can catch it, and until this target existed nothing checked that: `make anchors` verifies
# their anchors resolve and stops there. A gap closed by somebody's new test would sit
# there asserting the opposite for ever — which happened, and running this is how the
# RestoreFolder row got promoted. mutate.py also errors on an `elsewhere` row that turns
# out to be caught here, telling you to drop the annotation.
#
# Rows marked "slow" are skipped BY NAME rather than waited out: two of them are the
# harness's own timeout cases (a merge loop whose flipped advance guard never terminates, a
# halved curve slope that doubles what its one-unit loops must climb), and each burns a full
# SUITE_TIMEOUT every run. What they assert is a property of that bound, not of any test.
