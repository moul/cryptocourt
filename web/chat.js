// Court chat, client side.
//
// A standalone file rather than another block inside index.html, for two reasons.
// The page is one 20k-line document that several workstreams edit at once, and this
// is the one feature whose input is entirely attacker-controlled — it is worth being
// able to read all of it at once. Everything here is a plain function on `window`,
// same as the rest of the page; there is no bundler and no module system.
//
// THE THREAT MODEL, because it is not the usual one. Every string this file renders
// was typed by an anonymous stranger with no account, and the server deliberately
// does NOT strip markup: internal/chat.SanitizeBody erases invisible characters and
// normalises width, and otherwise preserves exactly what the author wrote, so that
// what the moderator's model reads is what a human reads. That decision puts the
// entire burden of not executing it here. Three rules follow, and none of them may
// be relaxed for a nicer-looking panel:
//
//   1. Every interpolated value goes through chatEsc. No exceptions, including
//      monikers, country codes and numbers.
//   2. Nothing is ever linkified. A scam works when its link is clickable; the whole
//      point of the moderator is defeated if the panel upgrades "gnot-claim.xyz"
//      into an anchor while the classifier is still deciding. URLs render as text.
//   3. The log is REPLACED from a full fetch, never appended to incrementally. See
//      chatFetch: moderation has to be able to take a message away.
//
// WHAT A MONIKER IS WORTH: nothing. Nobody owns "alice" and there is no login. What
// makes the room legible is `suffix` — six hex characters derived from the author's
// address, salted per court and per day. Two people typing the same name have
// different suffixes, so impersonation is visible. The suffix is therefore rendered
// inseparably from the name and must never be dropped as visual clutter; without it
// the panel actively invites impersonation. It rotates daily on purpose, so it is
// recognition within a conversation and never an identity to trust across days.

// CHATLIMITS mirrors the server's limits, and it is one object because it was five values.
//
// internal/chat/sanitize.go enforces these; the panel repeats them so a user hears "too long"
// before a round trip rather than after one. That makes them two definitions of one thing in
// two languages, which is the shape that has produced most of the bugs in this service — so
// they are declared once here and internal/chat/paneldrift_test.go reads this file and fails if
// the numbers stop matching the constants.
//
// Drift is bad in both directions and neither is loud: too small refuses text the server would
// happily take, too large accepts text the server then rejects with a 400 the user cannot act
// on. `maxlength` is included because it physically stops typing, so a stale value there is a
// capability quietly removed rather than a message shown.

// CHATDEFAULTNAME is who you are when you have not said. It is the server's
// DefaultMoniker and paneldrift_test.go pins the two together: a panel promising one
// default while the server stores another is exactly that test's subject.
//
// It is the name field's PLACEHOLDER rather than its value, so nothing is typed into
// the field on a reader's behalf and their first keystroke is not a deletion — a grey
// "anon" in an empty field says what you will be called if you leave it, which is the
// same fact with less furniture. The blank field is what the server defaults.

// CHATHOLD is how long a read may hang waiting for something to happen, in
// seconds. It is the OLD POLL INTERVAL, and that is the whole argument: the hold
// is a floor on how stale this panel can be about anything the chat server does
// not itself do.
//
// A post wakes every held read in that court immediately, which is the point of
// the exercise — a message crosses a room in a round trip instead of in up to six
// seconds. But an operator's kick is applied by kourtchatctl against the DATABASE,
// in another process, so nothing in the server wakes: a kicked reader finds out
// when their hold expires. Fifteen seconds of holding made that fifteen seconds of
// typing into a box that was already refusing them — caught by chat_live, which
// waits twenty for the composer to disable and got there with nothing to spare.
//
// So the hold matches the interval it replaces. Delivery gets faster; nothing gets
// staler; the request rate is what it always was. A longer hold would buy fewer
// requests on an idle court and pay for it in exactly the case that matters most.

// Devanagari a letter costs two or three code points: an eighteen-letter voweled

// THE MODES OF A TUNED CHURCH BELL: ratio to the prime, gain, decay seconds,
// and the split between the two halves of the doublet, in hertz.
//
// THIS IS MODAL SYNTHESIS, which is how any resonant metal object is modelled —
// a table of modes, each with its own frequency, amplitude and damping. The
// serious versions of this (STK, Faust, IRCAM's Modalys) get the table from a
// finite-element simulation of the actual casting or by analysing a recording.
// The table below is the tuned-bell partial set a founder works to, which is
// published and is the same data for every well-tuned bell of this shape.
//
// A BELL IS INHARMONIC, AND THAT IS WHY IT SOUNDS LIKE A BELL. A string or a
// pipe rings at whole-number multiples of its fundamental, which is what makes
// an organ an organ. A bell does not: the hum sits an octave BELOW the prime,
// and then there is a MINOR THIRD — 1.2, not 1.25 and nowhere near a whole
// number. That third is why a bell reads as solemn rather than sweet.
//
// EACH MODE IS A DOUBLET, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS GOT IT WRONG. A real
// casting is never perfectly symmetrical, so every mode splits into two
// frequencies a fraction apart, and the slow beating between them is the warble
// that makes a bell sound like an object rather than a waveform. The first
// version set `detune` on a SINGLE oscillator per mode — which shifts its pitch
// slightly and produces no beating whatsoever, because beating needs two tones
// to beat against. Hence a split in hertz and two oscillators per row.
//
// AND THE MODES DECAY AT DIFFERENT RATES, which is the other half of it. The
// high ones are gone inside a second while the hum is still sounding many
// seconds later, so the sound DARKENS as it falls. Partials that faded together
// would be a synthesiser playing a chord.
//
// The strike note a listener actually hears is in none of these rows: it is a
// virtual pitch the ear infers, mostly from the nominal — which is why a big
// bell reads far lower than any single frequency present in it.

// THE RECORDING: Emmanuel, the 13-tonne bourdon of Notre-Dame de Paris, taken
// on 15 April 2019 — the uploader's own note says it is the deepest-toned bell of
// the cathedral recorded BEFORE the fire that day. Public domain (CC0), so it
// carries no attribution obligation; credited here because it is worth knowing
// what you are listening to.
//
// CHOSEN BY MEASUREMENT, not by taste. Twelve real bells were cut to ten seconds
// from the strike and measured: the ones preferred all had a spectral centroid
// at or under 1100Hz, and the ones rejected were all 1580 and above — including
// one that rang LONGER than any of the keepers and was refused for being bright.
// The quality wanted was darkness, not resonance. Emmanuel measures 642 with a
// 9.8s decay, darker and longer than anything else found.
//
// CUT BEFORE THE SECOND STRIKE, which is the whole reason the clip is 3.15s and
// not longer. Emmanuel is a SWINGING bell: it comes back and strikes again, and
// at seven seconds the recording caught the return — reported as "the bell
// chimes twice". Measured in the envelope: a clean decay to 0.25 of the peak by
// 3.00s, then a 1.73x rise at 3.25s. The linear fade now reaches silence before
// that, so what is heard is one chime.
//
// A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN A DATA URI, so the page stays the size it is: this
// is fetched once, on the first ring, and cached by the browser thereafter.
// THE QUERY IS THE FILE'S OWN FINGERPRINT, and it is what makes force-cache

// bell.mp3 is served with NO cache-control at all, so a browser caches it
// heuristically, and force-cache tells it not even to revalidate. A corrected
// recording under an unchanged URL therefore never arrives.
//
// So the URL changes when the bytes do. check-bell-version recomputes this

/* THE TWO SET MARKS, and this file keeps its own copies for the reason chatEsc
   keeps its own escaper: chat.js is loaded beside the page but does not depend on
   it, and a constant reached across that line is a constant that breaks when the
   panel is rendered anywhere else.
   SPELLED AS ESCAPES, never as the glyph, for the realm's own reason: the Egyptian
   block holds several eyes that are one picture at this size, and a source file
   showing a picture instead of a number is a file where the wrong one gets pasted
   in and nobody sees it.
   TWO MARKS, ONE MEANING, AND ONE DIFFERENCE. Both make a set. Which one an author
   typed says what state the set is in when a reader arrives, and nothing else. The
   hover word is the whole of that difference, so it is said on hover rather than
   left to be learned.
   THE MAP IS THE SENTENCE. Key is the mark, value is what it opens as — so there is
   no `word` field to keep beside a `mark` field and no way for the pair to drift
   apart, because they are not a pair. Reading it is `CHATSETMARKS[mark]`, which is
   the same lookup a reader does in their head.
   AND THERE IS NO LENGTH CAP HERE, which is a deletion rather than an omission.
   This carried the realm's 1..200 folder-name limit, mirrored into CHATLIMITS and
   pinned to governedset.gno by check-web-constants — and it changed nothing. The
   only consumer is a lookup in the court's live set names, and that map can only
   HOLD names the realm accepted, so a longer one misses whether it is rejected
   here or not. Measured: a 250-rune name yields no link either way.
   THE DATA ALREADY CARRIES THE RULE, which is why the cap could go and the guard
   entry with it — a pin on a number nothing reads is one more thing to keep true
   for no benefit. */

   really has that claim. Unlike a set heading — which IS the whole message — this

   RUN ON THE ESCAPED TEXT, which is what makes the exclusion below load-bearing.
   chatEsc turns an apostrophe into `&#39;` and a backtick into `&#96;` — both of
   which END IN A HASH FOLLOWED BY DIGITS. A pattern reading the escaped string
   without refusing a preceding `&` turns every apostrophe in the room into a link
   to claim 39, and every backtick into claim 96. Both are ordinary typing.
   NO LEADING ZERO, so `#019` and `#0` stay plain: the displayed text is what was
   typed and the href is the number, and those two must not disagree.
   AND THE COURT MUST SAY SO. claimIsReal lives in the page, not here — chat.js
   reads no chain by design, the same reason it carries its own escaper — so a
   panel loaded alone, or on a court whose count was never read, links nothing.

     rather than the {"error": ...} this reads. The old wording spent the one
     line a reader gets on a status code, which tells them nothing they can act
     on, and pointed the blame at the chat — the one component that was working.
     `d === null` IS THE TEST, not the status: it is exactly "the JSON parse
     threw", which no app response ever does. Keeping 429 and 410 above it means
     a proxy's own rate limit still reads as one. */

   REPORTED AS "strange how the chat has padding around it" AND, of the warning,
   "it doesn't make sense that it should be both transparent (see stars behind
   it) and it occludes scrolled chat". Both were the same mistake. The panel was
   drawn as a widget wedged under page content — a rule across the top, a margin
   above it, a padding below it, no edges anywhere else — and the sky was painted
   on the WHOLE panel, so the head and the composer stayed put while the
   transcript slid underneath them and yet were painted as though they were the
   backdrop. Pinned like a layer, painted like a background: the eye is told two
   incompatible things and reads the head as occluding something.
   SO THE SKY MOVED TO .chatlog. It belongs to the thing that scrolls. The
   panel's own opaque base then paints every pinned band for free — no
   per-element background, no colour repeated in five rules, and nothing left
   that can show a constellation through the box you type into. A hairline above
   and below the log says where the scrolling region is, which is the one fact
   the old panel never stated. */

   NO ANGLE BRACKETS IN THIS COMMENT EITHER, for the reason below and one more:
   chat_test asserts the stylesheet carries no markup characters at all, because a
   style block is as good a place to smuggle markup as any. Naming the two tags
   the ordinary way is what turned this note red.
   WHAT IS LEFT IS WHAT AN ANCHOR ACTUALLY NEEDS: keep the body's colour, since
   the accent belongs on the name and not on the mark, and drop the underline it
   would otherwise wear at rest — hovering is what puts one on.
   MEASURED, NOT READ. Computed style comes out identical for every property this
   rule used to name except one: text-align resolves to "start" now instead of
   "left". That is inert here — the element is inline, so text-align aligns nothing
   of its own — and the rendered geometry is byte-identical in BOTH directions,
   checked with dir=rtl as well as ltr, which is the only case where those two
   words could differ. "start" is also the right default for a panel that renders
   whatever script somebody types.
   NO BACKTICKS IN THIS COMMENT, and that is not style: every line here lives
   inside the CHATCSS template literal, so one backtick ends the string and the
   file stops parsing. It cost a red suite writing this very note. */

   fixes. In the rail the panel is a flex COLUMN (index.html's .railchat), and
   its rule for every direct child of .railchat sets min-height:0 there, which
   removes the automatic
   minimum size that normally stops a flex item shrinking below its content. All
   these rows still had flex-shrink:1, so a short window shrank them TOGETHER
   rather than letting the log absorb it alone: measured at a 700px viewport,
   .chatform collapsed to a 10px box while the 35px name button inside it
   overflowed 25px BELOW that box, and .chatnote — the panel's last child, so
   painted on top — covered the overflow.
   That is why the reported symptom was so strange. The button's top padding is
   still inside the form's own box and takes the pointer; its LETTERS sit in the
   overflow, where the note gets the hit instead, so the cursor stays auto and
   the click lands on a div. Nothing was wrong with the button, the cursor, or
   the browser, and none of it appears in a tall window — which is the only kind
   I had been measuring in.
   So the log is the one row that shrinks (it has flex:1 1 auto and its own
   max-height and scrollbar), and everything else is pinned. If the rail ever
   gets too short for the fixed rows it clips the NOTE, the least important

   for a reader who needs it; this stops the browser doing it uninvited.
   AND 44px OF TARGET, which is the other half. MEASURED at 390x844: send 60x35,

   something you hit with a thumb.

   phone viewport, so a rule written that way cannot be exercised by any browser
   check in this repo — an untestable guard for a defect nobody would notice

   already uses for the same distinction.

     thinnest part of our own galaxy toward the north galactic pole in Coma. That
     is exactly why the sky beside Leo is full of distant galaxies and empty of
     gas -- so what continues off the rail's right edge is a galaxy field.
     ITS BLACK POINT IS THE RAIL'S SKY. The image is graded so input black maps to
     rgb(21,17,44), which is the rail's own rendered sky, and input white to a
     lavender rather than a pure one. The two panels then share a ground instead
     of merely being near each other in tone: measured, rail 249.9deg at 11.8%
     lightness against this at 253deg and 11.4%. The veil's job is only the last
     of that match, which is why it is .3 here and was .8 over a photograph that
     had not been graded to fit.
     NO BACKTICK AND NO DOLLAR-BRACE ANYWHERE IN HERE. The whole block is one
     template literal; a stray pair closes it early and takes every page with it,
     not just the chat. Two backticks in this very paragraph did exactly that once.
     AND THE CLOSING SEQUENCE OF A COMMENT IS NOT SPELLABLE IN ITS OWN PROSE --
     doing that closed this block early twice, leaving bare prose inside the rule.
     CSS drops a declaration block it cannot parse, so background-image computed
     to none and the sky simply went out: visible in a screenshot, invisible to
     anything that only reads the source. */

  /* WRITING THE LOG HAS TO PRESERVE THE READER'S SCROLL POSITION, or someone
     reading back through a thread gets yanked to the bottom every few seconds.
     That is what the `atBottom` test is for and it stays.

     BUT IT CANNOT BE THE ONLY THING, and the bug it caused was reported as "the
     chat sometimes doesn't scroll down to the latest message on loading".
     Sometimes, because it depends on whether the box had been laid out yet: the
     first transcript can arrive before the panel has a height, and then
     scrollTop is set to a scrollHeight that is about to change. Once layout
     happens the content is taller than the box and the reader is looking at the
     TOP of the thread, with nothing left to retry the scroll — a paint was the
     only thing that ever scrolled.

     TWO MECHANISMS, for two different moments:
       1. re-pinned in a rAF as well as immediately — the frame in which the
          browser has actually measured what was just written. This is what fixes
          the reported bug; MEASURED, by removing it and watching chat_scroll
          fail.
       2. while the reader has not scrolled away, a change in the BOX's size
          re-pins it: a rail opening, a window made taller, the panel getting its
          height late.

     AND WHAT (2) DOES NOT COVER, said plainly because the first draft of this
     comment claimed it did: a ResizeObserver on the log does NOT fire when the
     log's CONTENT grows. The box has a fixed height, so a late webfont or a late
     image changes scrollHeight and not the observed size — MEASURED: the
     callback ran on observe and on a height change, and not once when the rows
     were doubled. Content growth is covered by the next paint instead, which
     re-pins if the reader is still at the foot, and the panel paints on every
     poll.

     `pinned` is kept current from the scroll event and not only from paints, or
     a reader who scrolled up would be dragged back by the next box resize. */

       up in. nearBottom() is the right rule for somebody ELSE talking: it is
       what stops a poll yanking a reader out of the thread they are reading.
       It is the wrong rule for the reader's own send, which is the one message
       they are certainly waiting to see, and it takes very little scrolling to

      /* A WITHDRAWAL HAS NOTHING NEWER TO WAIT FOR, which is why /delete looked
         broken. Reported as: "i typed /delete but it didn't remove it from my
         chat... after i type /delete then type something else, then my previous
         text got replaced" — the row did go, six to eight seconds later, and
         the reader's next message is what made the repaint visible.
         THE POLL WAS WAITING FOR A MESSAGE THAT WILL NEVER COME. tick() was
         already called right here, but a poll holds for CHATHOLD seconds until
         something NEWER than `seen` exists, and hiding a row creates no new id.
         The server's wake cannot rescue it either: the wake fires while the POST
         is being answered, before this poll has subscribed, so the read that
         follows blocks for the whole hold and only then paints the window with
         the row gone.
         `first` IS THE EXISTING "READ NOW" PATH — the flag the very first poll
         of a mount uses to skip the hold — and a withdrawal wants exactly that.
         Reusing it beats a second parameter threaded through chatFetch for the
         same effect.
         AND A REFUSAL DESCRIBES THE RULE, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS NAMING THE
         REASON. deleted:0 means the rule said no, and the server returns that
         one bit on purpose: a caller learns whether their own last message went
         and nothing about anybody else's.
         "NOTHING OF YOURS TO TAKE BACK" WAS THE FIRST WORDING AND IT WAS FALSE
         from the reader's side. Reported as: "it says nothing of yours to take
         back but the last chat was from a previous deployment from me". Measured
         in the store: every one of the last six rows in that room WAS theirs,
         and the three newest were already withdrawn — the newest ROW is a
         tombstone, and the rule is "the newest row, if it is yours and still
         visible", which refuses without walking backwards. That refusal is the
         point (a cascade would let anybody erase their whole side of a
         conversation one command at a time), but the sentence claimed the one
         thing that was not true: that none of it was theirs.
         So it states the rule instead. Every refusal this can see — a tombstone
         on top, somebody else's line last, an empty room — is covered by it, and
         it asserts nothing the client cannot know. */

  // somebody learns their timeout has expired — so the cost is not only missed messages.

  // forever. The removal is what the unmount arm of the test exists for.
