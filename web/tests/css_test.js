// into — declared `background:var(--bg)`, and this stylesheet has never had a
// `--bg`. The page palette is `--paper`. An unknown custom property is NOT a CSS
// error: the declaration is dropped at computed-value time and everything else
// in the rule keeps working, so the panel laid out perfectly and rendered
// completely transparent. The claim page underneath stayed visible and the map's
// own bar drew on top of it, which the owner reported as "curate, close are
// superimposed on top of Stake on claim... basically the background is too
// visible".
//
// Twenty-two harnesses and none of them looked at the stylesheet. They slice
// JavaScript out of the page and check what it computes; CSS was assumed to be
// declarative enough not to have bugs. A typo'd variable name is a bug that no
// amount of checking the geometry can see, because the geometry was right.
