// References inside a claim's body and inside its comments.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. People write "#19" and "𓁼 Fauci" in prose, because that is
// how the page itself names those things — and it was dead text, so following a
// reference meant reading the number, going back to the docket, and finding it
// by hand.
//
// THE COURT DECIDES WHETHER A REFERENCE RESOLVES, and the two lookups that
// answer already existed for the chat rail: claimIsReal and setFidByName. This
// reuses them rather than walking the folder tree a second time, which is what
// the first draft did. The consequence worth naming: a claim page and the chat
// panel beside it can never disagree about whether #19 is real in this court.
//
// SILENCE IS NOT A LINK. A court whose count or folders were never read answers
// "no" to everything, and so does a DIFFERENT court — the one wrong answer that
// would look right is #19 here pointing at #19 somewhere else.
//
// THE ENTITY HAZARD IS THE REASON THE PATTERN IS BORROWED RATHER THAN WRITTEN.
// This runs on ESCAPED text, so an apostrophe in the body is `&#39;` — and a
// naive /#(\d+)/ turns the tail of an escaped quote into a link to claim 39.
// chat.js already had the `[^&\w]` guard for exactly this; the version first
// written here did not, and this file's first run caught it.
