// The /raw route's second view: the chain's markdown SET, beside the source.
//
// WHY THIS HARNESS EXISTS. /raw showed the markdown as characters and nothing
// else, so /raw/covid/mod opened on a wall of `#`, `**` and `[…](…)` — the log
// reads as unreadable when the log is fine. The route grew a toggle and a small
// renderer, and a renderer is exactly the shape of thing this suite is for:
// string in, HTML out, no browser needed.
//
// AND IT IS A TRUST BOUNDARY, which is the real reason. Everything this thing
// is handed came off a chain: claim titles, folder names, moderator addresses,
// evidence URLs, all written by strangers. index.html's claimBody deliberately
// does NOT interpret its field as markdown for that exact reason, so the one
// place that DOES interpret chain text as markup has to be pinned: escaped
// before anything else, one closed set of inline forms, and a link that may only
// go to this view's own route or to plainly http(s).
//
// THE VOCABULARY IS THE REALM'S, not CommonMark's. Assertions cover what
// modrender.gno, electionrender.gno, courtrender and media.gno actually emit —
// headings, joined paragraphs, bullets nested one level, blockquotes, rules,
// bold, em, inline code, links, image destinations — and no more. A form the
// realm never writes is not a gap here; adding one would be surface for no page.
