// How an amount of court coin is written, and where its symbol belongs.
//
// WHY THIS HARNESS EXISTS. Nothing tested the money formatters at all — not
// ccFigure, not cc, not ccRow — and the claim page's "Reward to open" row shipped
// printing the symbol TWICE: cc() ends in ccSymHtml, and the call site appended
// ccSym() after it, so the row read "596 µKourt:COVID KOURT:COVID". A reader
// reported it before any check did, because there was no check to do it.
//
// THE TWO SHAPES ARE A DELIBERATE PAIR, and the distinction is the whole design:
//
//   cc(n, slug)   names the coin, because most callers need it to. The account
//                 popover and the wallet list balances ACROSS courts, and "0.74"
//                 there is a number with no denomination.
//   ccPlain(n)    says the amount alone, in CC, for a surface that has already
//                 said which court — a claim page has it in the crumbs, the
//                 heading and the URL, so repeating KOURT:COVID beside every
//                 figure spends width on something the reader already knows.
//
// AND ccPlain KEEPS ONE UNIT. ccFigure drops to a micro prefix below 0.01 CC,
// which renders a small reward as "596 µ" — a different unit from every other
// figure on the same page, for no reason except that the number is small.
// ccPlain spends decimals instead, and the floor it has to clear is that a
// non-zero amount is never shown as 0.00: that is the only thing the micro
// prefix was protecting against.

   the 0.74 and 0.0006 arms pin, and narrowing the loop fires them. The floor
   under all of it is the final toFixed(6), which is why capping the loop at two

/* THE CONTRACT CHANGED HERE, and this is what it changed to. It used to be
   "cc() names the coin and ccPlain does not", and the claim page took the second
   one everywhere — so "accuracy 0.00 · author 0.00 · answerer 0.00 · voters
   0.0001 CC" sat under tiles wearing the gold bar, the same coin drawn two ways
   on one page. Reported exactly that way.
   What the original reasoning actually established was that the unit should not
   be REPEATED per figure — which is why ccFig has no micro mode and why a row
   says its unit once. It never established that the one surviving unit should be
   spelled as an initialism. So the unit is still said once, and now said in the
   product's own mark.
   Still asserted as a PAIR, for the reason the old comment gave: the two
   formatters must stay distinguishable, so a future edit cannot quietly collapse
   them. The difference is no longer symbol-vs-none — it is that cc() carries the
   µ prefix machinery for a wallet listing across courts, and ccPlain keeps one
   unit and spends decimals for a page that is already inside one court. */
