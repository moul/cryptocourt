// already found wrong, and neither may claim staking is refused when it is not.

/* THE INDEX IS STILL THE ASSERTION, AND IT NOW POINTS THE OTHER WAY. This

   time: ClaimVoteWeightOf returns (verdict, quality), the two weigh at
   different epochs, and reading w[0] "would render a verdict-epoch figure
   under a quality question" with nothing on the page looking wrong.
   ITS PREMISE WAS A QUALITY QUESTION ON THAT PAGE, and there is not one. The
   quality lane went; nothing assigns the second return, so it is always 0. The
   span it fills sits in the dispute explainer under "What casting costs you",
   whose prose is entirely about overturning an answer — a VERDICT vote. And
   voteLockFigures omits the sentence when the figure is not above zero, so
   what this arm was protecting was a panel that never printed "this vote would
   commit N" for anybody, on any claim.
   The consequence is worth stating plainly, because the old comment said the
   opposite: nothing looked wrong, and the one number a voter wants before
   voting was missing. Re-pointed to index 0 — the verdict weight, under a
   verdict question — with the same tuple-position discipline. The rendered
