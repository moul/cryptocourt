// Asked for: no separate chip row — the Folders rows above the search ARE the
// control. Nothing ticked by default, which shows everything; tick a folder and
// it lights up and the search, Open and Recently settled narrow to what is in
// it, counts included.
//
// NOTHING TICKED IS NOT "EVERY FOLDER TICKED", and the difference is the reason
// this default was chosen: a court's claims are not all filed, so an all-ticked
// default has to answer what becomes of the unfiled ones. An empty selection has
// nothing to answer, and the control reads as off when it is doing nothing.
//
// Measured rather than read: the effect is entirely layout and computed style,
// and the counts are rendered from data and rewritten live — an earlier version
// hid rows correctly while both headings went on announcing the full docket.

         block's second among them.
     THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT THE SECOND ABLATION FIRED NOTHING, and it was the
     instrument that was broken, not the assertion: it froze the count through a
     `let CAPREST` while assigning to `window.CAPREST`, which are different
     bindings, so the mutation was a no-op and the run was green for the same
