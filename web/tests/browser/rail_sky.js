// The rail is the night sky, and Leo is up by the throne.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The sidebar's ground moved from the chat panel to the whole
// rail, and every fact that makes that work is invisible in the source:
//
//   1. .rail must re-resolve --ink for its own subtree. Overriding the token is
//      NOT enough — what inherits into the rail is body's COMPUTED rgb, resolved
//      against :root long before it arrives. Without `color:var(--ink)` on the
//      rail, .brand .mark stayed #16202a on the light theme: near-black text on
//      a near-black sky. Nothing in the source looks wrong; the sidebar is just
//      blank where a name should be.
//   2. The rail's chat slot wears .railchat AND .chatpanel ON ONE ELEMENT, so
//      `.railchat .chatpanel` — the descendant form, which is what anyone writes
//      first — matches nothing. It matched nothing here, and the panel kept
//      painting its own sky: a second gradient with its own top stop halfway
//      down the column, and a second Leo, since the plate carries the
//      constellation. The render looked finished.
//   3. Leo has to land near the throne. The plate is real sky at one
//      right-ascension window, so the constellation sits at a fixed 44% of the
//      plate's height and is placed by a -169px offset that depends on the rail's
//      width. Change the rail's width and Leo slides off the brand block.
//   4. The starfield has to stop before the plate's own bottom edge does, or the
//      edge reads as a seam across the sidebar. Both numbers moved when the rail
//      and the chat panel were made to fade as ONE horizon: the plate was
//      extended south to Dec -75 so it runs to about y 766, and the scrim was
//      moved down to 45vh/78vh to follow it, because the panel begins 205px down
//      the page and could not share a fade that had already closed by 300px. The
//      invariant is the same one; only the two numbers are different.
//
// HOW 4 IS MEASURED. Not by reading CSS — by turning the RAIL's plate layer off
// and comparing screenshot bytes strip by strip. A strip whose bytes change is a
// strip with stars in it. That is what settled where the field actually ends,
// after a downscaled screenshot suggested stars near the foot that were really
// the demo dot and some punctuation.
//
// AND WHAT THAT MEASUREMENT CANNOT SEE, which an ablation had to teach it: the
// override it injects names `.rail`, so a sky painted by the PANEL survives in
// both shots and the strips come out identical. The strip diff is blind to case
// 2 by construction — reverting the reset to `.railchat .chatpanel` leaves every
// strip unchanged and only the slot-background arm above fires. Two arms for two
// facts, and the header used to claim the wrong one caught it.
//
// Ablated, and each fires on the arm named: dropping `color:var(--ink)` from
// .rail fails both light-theme arms (rail color rgb(22,32,42), worst contrast
// 1.08:1); writing the chat reset as `.railchat .chatpanel` fails the slot arm
// alone, for the reason just given; moving the plate offset back to the chat
// panel's -34px fails the Leo arm (figure at y 151..259, well below the throne's
// 22..54); leaving the scrim open to 97vh fails the no-seam arm with stars at
// every strip down to 780.
//
// AND THE NO-SEAM ARM WAS BLIND TWICE, both found by ablating it rather than by
// reading it. It re-declared the whole background-image to hide the plate, which
// meant it carried a hand-copied second version of the scrim -- so when the real
// scrim moved, the copy went stale and every strip differed for a reason that had
// nothing to do with stars. It now zeroes the plate layer's background-size
// instead, which changes one thing and cannot drift. And its sample rows jumped
// 660 -> 800 while the scrim closes at 741 and the plate ends at 766, so the only
// band where a seam can appear was never looked at: the arm above passed against
// a scrim left open past the edge. Four rows at 700/745/760/780 fixed that.
