// HOW MANY ARE IN THE ROOM, ABOVE THE BOX YOU TYPE INTO.
//
// Asked for in those terms — "the chat should also above the chat box show how
// many people are active" — and the placement is the requirement, not a detail:
// the moment that number matters is when you are deciding whether it is worth
// saying anything, which is when you are looking at the composer.
//
// WHY A BROWSER. "Above" is a fact about layout. A source test can find the
// element in the markup and say nothing about where it ends up, and this panel
// is a flex column whose order comes from the stylesheet as much as from the
// HTML — so the assertion is geometric: the line's bottom edge must be at or
// above the form's top edge, on screen.
//
// AND WHAT IT MUST NOT SAY. The count includes the site's own answerer as one
// more anonymous participant, decided server-side, and the panel is given a
// total with no way to decompose it. So this also checks that the line names no
// helper, no bot and no machine of any kind — if it did, the count would be the
// thing that gave the answerer away.

// THE PANEL MOVED OUT OF THE RAIL. It is a view of its own at
// #/c/<slug>/chat — "it's probably a bad idea to have chat in the sidebar to
// begin with" — so this harness visits the panel's own page rather than a
// court's docket. The arms below are unchanged: what they measure is the panel,
// and the panel is the same panel.

     that branch cannot be reached from this harness: showHere is a closure
     inside mountChat, and the sample always supplies a count. The first version
     of this file "tested" it by setting hidden and textContent itself and then

     itself covered by NEITHER. MEASURED: deleting showHere(d.here) from the poll
     failed zero tests, source and browser alike. The demo path calls showHere
     with its own constant, so it cannot notice.
