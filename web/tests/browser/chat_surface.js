// WHAT IS PINNED MUST NOT BE PAINTED AS BACKDROP.
//
// THE REPORT, VERBATIM: "it's strange how the chat has padding around it. also the
// dimissable 'names are unverified...'. it doesn't make sense that it should be both
// transparent (see stars behind it) and it occludes scrolled chat" — and then, on
// being asked: "i'm not saying it actually occludes anything, it's hard to explain.
// it's as if it occludes something because it is 'sticky' as compared to the chat
// scroll below, and yet it is also transparent supposedly at the same time".
//
// Nothing was overlapping. The panel is a flex column and the warning is a static
// block above the log; no z-index, no position, nothing to occlude with. The defect
// was that the panel told the eye two incompatible things. Only .chatlog scrolls, so
// the head above it and the composer below it HOLD STILL while text slides between
// them — which is how a layer behaves. And the starfield was painted on the whole
// panel, so those same held-still bands were painted as though they were the
// backdrop — which is how a background behaves. Constellation lines ran through the
// box you type into. Held like a layer, painted like a background: read as occluding.
//
// SO THE INVARIANT IS A RELATIONSHIP, NOT A COLOUR, and that is what these arms
// measure. The sky belongs to the one region that moves. Nothing above or below it
// may have sky behind it — not the band itself and not any ancestor of it, which is
// the form the bug actually took: .chathead was always transparent and always will
// be, and it was the PANEL underneath that carried the plate.
//
// WHY A BROWSER. Every arm here is either a used value (an inherited font-size times
// a rem), a painted-ancestor walk, or two rectangles' edges. None of the three is a
// string in the stylesheet, and the last one is the reason the margin-to-padding
// conversion is load-bearing rather than tidying: a margin between two opaque bands
// is a gap that shows whatever is behind the panel, and before the plate moved, what
// was behind the panel was stars.
