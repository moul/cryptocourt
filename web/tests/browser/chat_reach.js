// The composer's buttons can be hit ON THEIR LETTERS, in a short window.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A reader reported that the name chip and send took no click
// and showed no pointer when the cursor was directly over their letters, while
// the PADDING of the same buttons worked and every other button on the page
// worked. Four fixes were shipped from the wrong theory — user-select, a
// pointer-events:none label wrapper, cache headers, a service worker — because
// every measurement here was taken in a tall window, where none of it happens.
//
// THE ACTUAL CAUSE, once a probe reported what was under the reader's pointer
// rather than under mine: `div.chatnote`. In the rail the panel is a flex
// COLUMN and index.html's `.railchat > *` sets min-height:0 on every child,
// which removes the automatic minimum size that stops a flex item shrinking
// below its content. Every row still had flex-shrink:1, so a short viewport
// shrank them together instead of letting the log absorb it alone: at 700px the
// form collapsed to a 10px box while the 35px button inside it overflowed 25px
// below, and .chatnote — the panel's last child, therefore painted on top —
// took the hit over the letters. The button's top padding stayed inside the
// form's own box, which is why the padding kept working. Fixed by pinning
// .chathead/.chatstate/.chatform/.chatnote to flex:0 0 auto.
//
// WHY IT IS MEASURED THIS WAY. The bug was invisible to every check already in
// the tree for three separate reasons, and this file is built against all three:
//   - IT ONLY EXISTS IN A SHORT WINDOW. The existing chat checks run at one
//     tall viewport, so the form never got squeezed. Heights are swept here,
//     and 800 is the shortest one in the list for the reason recorded below.
// EVERY HEIGHT IS SWEPT, AND THE ASSERTION IS "NOT COVERED" rather than "on
// screen without scrolling". At 620px the composer sits below the rail's fold
// and the rail scrolls to it, which is a normal thing a sidebar does; the bug
// was a control that was VISIBLE and took no click. So each control is scrolled
// into view if it is outside the viewport and then hit-tested, and the failure
// is landing on some other element.
//
//   - IT IS A HIT TEST, NOT A COUNT. The button was present, enabled, correctly
//     classed, cursor:pointer in its own style, and 35px tall the whole time —
//     every countable property was right. What was wrong is which element the
//     pointer reaches, so elementFromPoint at the button's CENTRE is the
//     assertion, the point where the letters are.
//   - THE OVERFLOW IS THE MECHANISM. A geometry arm compares the button's box
//     to its form's, so a future rule that lets the row collapse again fails
//     here with the reason attached rather than as a bare missed click.
//
// ABLATED against a CONTROL run of the unmodified stylesheet, which fires
// nothing — without that control "4 arms fired" is not evidence, since a copy
// broken for its own reasons reports the same. Counts are what actually fired,
// and the second one contradicts what this comment first predicted:
//   - remove the pin entirely -> 4. Send reaches `div.chatnote` at 900 and
//     `div.foot` at 800, and both geometry arms trip there: a 25px row holding
//     a 35px button, hanging 9px below it. The first of those is the shipped
//     bug reproduced by name.
//   - pin .chatform ALONE, leaving .chatnote shrinking -> 0, not the 2 this
//     comment claimed before the run. Pinning the form is on its own enough to
//     satisfy every arm here. So the .chathead/.chatstate/.chatnote half of the
//     pin is INTENT — the log is the designated absorber and the fixed rows say
//     so — and it is NOT covered behaviour. Anyone narrowing it will not be
//     caught by this file, which is worth knowing before trusting it.
// Both mutations are applied to a COPY of chat.js outside the repo: a second
// session edits these files, and an in-place mutation has already been written
// back once from that session's stale buffer.
//
// SWEPT DOWN TO 620 NOW, and the bound used to be 800 because of a second bug
// that is fixed. `.railchat` IS this panel, and it carried flex:1 1 auto with
// min-height:0 and overflow:hidden, so the rail handed it LESS height than its
// own controls occupy and clipped them — 159px of panel around a 232px composer
// at 800px, with send's centre landing on a stray <b> from the block painted
// underneath. Pinning the rows stopped them collapsing; it did not stop the
// container clipping them.
//
// It surfaced here because a nav link was added for the parameters page: the
// rail's nav went from five entries to six, the threshold moved up from ~700 to
// 800, and this file went red 3/3 — which is how a 28px addition to a sidebar
// turned into a dead button. Worth keeping in mind about this layout.
//
// Fixed by flooring the panel at min-content and giving .chatlog height:0, so
// min-content resolves to the CONTROLS rather than the controls plus a
// screenful of messages. The log yields instead: 127px at 1000, 27px at 900, 0
// by 800. Two alternatives were measured and rejected — a bare min-content
// floor with the log sized by its messages put the composer off-screen at every
// height (floor 469px), and a min-height on the log made the rail scroll even
// at 1000px while never shrinking.

     THE SWEEP ABOVE IS ALL AT WIDTH 1280, which is why it could not see this.
     Reported from a phone: "i can't see *any* chat there besides the input
     field." Measured at 390, 430 and 768 — the log's box was 0px tall with FOUR
     messages inside it and a scrollHeight of 194.
     BECAUSE THE FIX ABOVE ASSUMES A CONTAINER WITH HEIGHT TO GIVE AWAY. Below
     the layout's 820px breakpoint the rail is `position:static; height:auto`,
     so it sizes to its content and distributes no free space; the log's
     height:0 basis is then all it ever gets, and every message renders inside a
     zero-height box. The composer stayed visible, so the panel looked present
     and simply had nothing in it — the failure mode that gets reported as "chat
     doesn't work" rather than "chat is clipped".
     THE ARM IS THE ROW INSIDE THE LOG'S BOX, not the log's own height. A log

     About a hundred and twenty lines proved it worked: the log grew, the links

     most of the rail at 700 and at 1000, the way home stayed clickable, and a
     phone was never offered the button at all. All of it passed.
     IT WENT WITH THE SIDEBAR PANEL IT RESIZED. "it's probably a bad idea to have
     chat in the sidebar to begin with" — so there is no column to expand into
     and no nav to fold away; the chat has the page. The arms that survived the
     move are the ones about the panel itself, which are below and now measured
     on its own view: that it mounts and can be typed into at every width, that
     the keyboard reaches all of it, and that a phone gets targets a thumb can
     hit without the browser zooming.
     WHAT IS NOT COVERED ANY MORE, said plainly: nothing checks that the chat can
     be made bigger, because nothing can — the view is as big as the viewport
     allows and there is no second size to reach. */

  /* ---- THE SEAM IS NOT A CONTROL ANY MORE ---------------------------------
     THERE WAS A DRAG HANDLE, and roughly two hundred lines here proved it
     worked: a dotted grip drawn at rest, a keyboard separator, a clamp at each
     end, a reset that appeared only once a size was set, and a check that no
     nav item painted under it. All of it passed. It is gone anyway.
     WHY, in the owner's words: "when i drag it down lower past 'Realm
     parameters' ... instead of the top of the chat getting dragged downward, the
     chat div drags upward from the bottom", and then "the whole ...... drag
     thing is confusing" and "it's hard to even explain how to fix issues with
     it". That last sentence is the one that settled it. Three fixes had already
     landed against this control — a jump on first grab, a re-pin at the clamp, a
     sticky handle scrolling out of its own scroller — and a fourth symptom was
     still arriving. A control whose failures cannot be described is not a
     control anybody can reason about.
     WHAT REPLACED IT IS NOT A CONTROL AT ALL. The log has a floor and the links
     yield by scrolling, so the panel is usable without anybody arranging it.
     MEASURED, and this is why the handle had felt necessary: before the floor,
     the log was 0px tall at 1440 wide on every desktop height tested — 900, 800
     and 700 — because the nav's links take 333px and the panel's own controls
     take the rest. The drag was not a convenience on top of a working layout, it
     WAS the layout. At 700 the original could not even reach the composer.
     SO THESE ARMS MEASURE THE FLOOR AND THE ABSENCE OF THE HANDLE, and the
     expand toggle keeps its own section above — one button, two states, which is
     the whole of the sizing story now. */

     is that everything left in the panel can be reached and used without a

     AND ENTER TO SEND WAS NOT TESTED AT ALL, which is the one worth having:
     chat.js handles Enter explicitly only in the NAME field, so the message box
     relies on native form submission. That is the right way to do it and it is
     exactly the kind of thing a later refactor breaks silently — chat_live's own
