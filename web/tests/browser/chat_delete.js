// /delete SCRUBS THE MESSAGE FROM EVERY PANEL, because the server stopped
// sending it.
//
// THERE IS NO DELETE MESSAGE AND NO CLIENT BOOKKEEPING, which is the design
// worth protecting. The panel re-reads the whole window on every poll and paints
// it wholesale — the same mechanism that makes a moderator's hide vanish from a
// screen already showing it, which pulse.go describes — so a withdrawn message
// simply is not in the next payload and disappears. Nothing has to interpret a
// command, and nothing has to remember what was removed.
//
// THAT IS ALSO WHAT COULD QUIETLY BREAK. If the panel ever appended to the log
// instead of replacing it — an optimisation somebody might reach for, since
// repainting fifty rows to add one looks wasteful — deletion would stop working
// while every other test kept passing. This is the test that would fail.
//
// TWO TABS, because "every browser" is the requirement and one panel cannot
// show that a second one also forgets. Two panels in ONE tab does not work —
// mountChat is single-instance per document, measured — and is not the scenario
// anyway.
