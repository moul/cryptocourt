// A CLAIM'S ROW IS THE SAME ROW ON THE COURT PAGE AND ON A SET PAGE.
//
// docketRow builds it for both, so they SHOULD be identical — and for a long
// time they were not, in ways nothing here noticed:
//
//   the stake figure  the court page filled `[data-pct]` from a sweep written
//                     inline in its own route; a set page drew the same cell and
//                     ran nothing, so every claim under every set showed an
//                     empty signal. Claim #10 read "82.4%" on one page and
//                     nothing on the other. Fixed by extracting fillDocketRows.
//   the clock         same cell, same story: `#clk-<slug>-<id>` never filled.
//   the fold keys     no keys passed meant `data-fold="~none"`, which does not
//                     mean "no filter here" — it means the claim is in NO
//                     folder, and every claim on a set page is in at least one.
//
// Each of those was found by hand, by fetching one row from both pages and
// diffing the strings. This is that diff, standing.
//
// THE ONE LEGITIMATE DIFFERENCE IS THE FOLDER META, and it is asserted rather
// than ignored. The court page names the first folder a claim is in, because
// there the folder is news. A set page names the SUBSET a claim came from, and
// says nothing at all for a claim filed in the set itself — repeating the name
// of the page you are on is not information. So: everything else identical, and
// the meta different in exactly that way.
//
// WHY A BROWSER. Both rows are built by one function, so a source test can only
// confirm that both callers exist; whether the two pages AGREE is a property of
// the settled DOM.
//
// AND WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, said plainly because it is the bug above. In demo
// mode the stake figure comes from docketRow itself — a demo claim carries its
// own pools, so both pages print "71.0%" with no fill running anywhere — and
// removing the set page's fillDocketRows call leaves this check green. MEASURED,
// by doing exactly that. The fill only matters against a live chain, which this
// harness has no access to.
// So the fill is covered where it can be: folders_test asserts that
// fillDocketRows is defined ONCE and called by BOTH routes, which is the thing
// that went wrong — a sweep living in one route. What this file adds is
// everything demo CAN show: the shell of the row, the fold keys, the clock cell,
// and the one difference that is meant to be there.
