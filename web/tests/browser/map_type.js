// The map's labels are the site's type, at the site's proportions.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Reported as "the map node font etc is different than the
// site. same font, and larger nodes too, i can't read". Nothing was wrong with
// the font-family: SVG text inherits from body, so the labels really were the
// page's --sans. They were that face STRETCHED — measured over the live covid
// docket, claim titles rendered 1.27x wider than their own glyphs on average
// and 1.41x at worst. A quarter-wider sans is not the same sans, and it reads
// as some other typeface entirely, which is what the report was describing.
//
// The cause was one constant doing two jobs. est() computed textLength as
// `len * fs * charW` with charW a single 0.62, while the real advance is 0.49em
// for a title, 0.55 for the court's name, 0.63 for an id — and the surplus was
// handed to `lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs"`, which spends it by SCALING THE
// OUTLINES. charW was right as the conservative fit budget it was written to
// be; it was never a rendering width.
//
// WHY A BROWSER CHECK AND NOT A SOURCE ONE. The fix measures with a canvas, so
// its whole value is in a real text engine's numbers. Under plain node —
// web/tests/*.js eval mapSvg directly — there is no document, mctx is null, and
// the estimate path runs instead. So the source harnesses cannot observe
// distortion even in principle: they would measure the fallback and pass. The
// division is deliberate and neither side subsumes the other:
//
//   web/tests/map_test.js   the label GEOMETRY — x, y, size, clipping, owner
//   this check              that the glyphs are undeformed and in the right face
//
// ABLATED, four ways, and the arm that fires is recorded because two of them
// fire somewhere other than where they were expected to:
//
//   forcing mctx=null, i.e. the old charW estimate   ratio 1.14, undeformed fails
//   lengthAdjust back to spacingAndGlyphs            ONLY the spacing arm fails
//   deleting the .mtitle/.mcourt-t serif rule        ratio 0.927, undeformed fails
//   mapFace measuring mcourt-t at 400, not 700        ratio 0.937, undeformed fails
//
// The second is why the lengthAdjust assertion has to exist separately: with a
// measured width the two modes render identically, so the ratios stay at 1.00
// and nothing else notices the unsafe mode is back. The third is the converse —
// removing the CSS face does NOT show up first as a face failure, because
// mapSvg measures in the face it believes is set, so a face changed in only one
// of the two places lands as distortion. Either way the check names the class.
