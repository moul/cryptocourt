// The chat panel ON THE REAL COURT PAGE.
// check-web-selectors: gone chatdry — the dry-run notice, removed in 6e5c1e1 at the owner's word
//
// chat_render.js tests the panel in isolation and chat_live.js tests it against a
// server. Neither touches index.html, and the wiring there is where the interesting
// failures live: it is one 20k-line document, its render() is async and re-entrant, and
// the panel is loaded from the only external file the page has ever had.
//
// THE CLAIM THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. web/README.md promises three times over that
// index.html is self-contained — "no build, no dependencies, no server needed", "just
// share the file". Adding chat.js has to leave that true, so the panel is loaded
// optionally and every call into it is guarded on typeof. That is a claim about what
// happens when a file is MISSING, which is not a thing source review establishes and
// not a thing the string-slicing harnesses can see. So it is measured: the court page
// is rendered with chat.js blocked at the network layer, and the docket must survive.
