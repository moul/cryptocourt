// The map actually DRAWS — nodes on screen, not an empty frame.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. "The map is shown" was verified three ways that all passed
// while proving nothing about pixels: the realm answers FolderTree, the overlay's
// parser accepts that string, and check-live-reads says every read returns a
// parseable shape. None of them renders anything. The map is built client-side
// from folders and claims, so every one of those can be green while the SVG comes
// out empty — and an empty map looks exactly like a court with nothing in it,
// which is the worst shape of failure because nothing suggests where to look.
//
// DEMO MODE, deliberately. The dataset ships in the file, so this runs anywhere
// with no node and no network — and the demo court is the one a first-time
// visitor lands on.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, stated because the first version of this comment
// claimed otherwise. The live FolderTree path is NOT exercised here: in demo mode
// the folders come from the shipped dataset and chainFolders is never called.
// Measured — breaking the parser to demand four colon-separated fields left this
// check ALL PASS, because it never runs that code. So the two guards are
// complementary and neither subsumes the other:
//
//   check-web-constants   the realm's row width vs the parser's, by source
//   this check            that a map with data in it reaches the screen
//
// A live-chain variant would be a third, with a different failure mode again —
// the chain being empty is not a bug in the map.
//
// Ablated on the paths demo mode DOES take: renaming .mapwrap fails the first
// three assertions, and returning an empty <svg> from mapSvg fails the node and
// label counts. Those are the two ways the frame can be there and the map not.

  /* THE VERDICT'S MARKS, PAINTED. A settled claim's node wears the oval the claim
     title wears and is struck through when the court ruled NO, and both of those
     are things web/tests/map_test.js can only read as strings: under node there
     is no stylesheet, so a hue that resolves to nothing and a rule the browser
     declines to draw both read as present there.
     RENDERED FROM A FIXTURE, not found on the demo map, because the demo court's
     one settled claim is a YES (`phase:"settled", verdict:0`) — so no strike
     exists on any page this check could navigate to, and the CSS for it would
     ship unexercised. The fixture is map_test.js's, and it is appended INSIDE
     .mapwrap so the map's own rules apply to it exactly as they do to the real
     one.
     Ablated, and each fires on the arm named: dropping `stroke` from .mstrike
     leaves it `none` — SVG's initial value, so the rule is not merely the wrong
     colour, there is no line at all — and fails the hue arm; giving .mvtag a
     fill fails the hairline arm; adding .mvtag to the `far` rule fails the
     zoomed-out arm; striking from the node's padding instead of the title's
     offset fails the crosses-the-sentence arm at x, 16px short.
     THE FILL ABLATION MOVED. It used to be "giving .mvtag a fill fails the
     hairline arm", which stopped being true when the oval left the frame: it is
     filled now, with the node's own surface, so the border it straddles does not
     run through the word. Giving it the SIDE's hue is the ablation that fires. */
