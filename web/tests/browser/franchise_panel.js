// The meta franchise, as it actually reaches a reader.
//
// WHY A BROWSER CHECK. franchise_test.js calls franchiseHtml directly and proves
// the WORDS; nothing proved the panel is ever filled. fillFranchise is an async
// fill into a slot the court page renders empty, so every failure mode it has is
// invisible to a source harness: the slot never mounted, the fill threw, the
// reads never landed, the court page stopped calling it.
//
// THAT GAP IS NOT THEORETICAL IN THIS FILE. Twice this week a top-level const
// read a name declared below it and threw on load, taking the whole script with
// it — and both times every source harness stayed green, because a harness
// evaluates a slice and sets the names it needs as globals first. One of those
// two was in this very feature: the sample's franchise map, written inside the
// DEMO object, in DEMO_ME's temporal dead zone. check-tdz now catches that
// shape; this catches the rest of the ways a fill can quietly not happen.
//
// AND THE PANEL IS THE ANSWER TO A REPORT. The front page showed a court that had
// burned thirteen thousand GNOT beside a meta court whose supply read zero, and
// the reader asked the only reasonable question: how can there be no meta tokens
// when there were tokens burned? Both figures were true. The entitlement between
// them was the sentence nobody had written.
