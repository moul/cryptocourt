// and pointed NOWHERE. That is half a disclosure: a reader who wanted to know
// what they were talking to had no page to go to. #/about now carries a section
// on it, and the notice's own phrase is the link.
//
// RENDERED, NOT SLICED OUT OF THE SOURCE, and that is deliberate. The nearest
// existing check reads the about page by slicing web/index.html between two
// <h2> markers, and its own comment records a bug that slipped past it for
// exactly that reason — an HTML comment is still present in source, so prose
// assertions can pass against text no reader sees. Everything here is asked of
// the page the browser built.
//
// AND THE LINK IS CLICKED. "The notice points nowhere" was the defect; asserting
// an href exists would not have caught it, because an href to a route that does
// not render is still an href.

     Everything below this line used to be about the route from the chat notice:

     model" itself, that it was underlined and no quieter than the sentence around
     it, and -- the arm the original defect would have failed -- that clicking it
     actually landed on a rendered #/about. The notice was removed from the panel
     on the owner's instruction as too wordy, so there is no link left to click.
     WHAT IS LEFT IS THE PAGE, AND IT IS UNCHANGED. Every claim above still holds
     and is still measured: what the clerk is, what it refuses, that it can be
     wrong and can be pushed around, and that none of it is worded as a guarantee.
