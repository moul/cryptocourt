// Every label-and-value row the overlay draws, measured WHERE IT LANDS.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A `.line` is the overlay's label-and-value row, and every
// rule for one was written as `.ticket .line`. That is invisible in the source:
// the markup a function emits is identical whether or not a ticket happens to be
// somewhere above it, so the same helper renders as two clean grid tracks on the
// ballot and as two bare inline spans on the quality panel, where the page read
//
//     what voting commitsCasting commits the weight you vote with, until...
//
// — the label and its prose printed as one word, with no emphasis and no column.
// Three source-reading tests pinned the exact text of those CSS rules and all
// three passed, because they proved the rule's TEXT and never that anything was
// inside its scope. Only a computed style can tell you which of the two a row
// actually got.
//
// So this crawls the demo the way route_crawl does and asks one question of
// every row it finds: did you come out as a grid? A row that did not is either
// in a container nobody styled or in one somebody renamed.
//
// It is deliberately not a list of routes. The bug was in a panel that renders
// only for a claim in a particular phase, and a hand-written route list is
// exactly the kind of thing that omits it.
