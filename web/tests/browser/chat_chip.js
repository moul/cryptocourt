// At rest the moniker field wore the same empty box as the message beside it,
// which said "type here" about a field that already holds an answer — you are
// anon — and put two identical invitations in a row where only one of them is
// asking for anything. It rests as a chip in the send button's clothes now, and
// turns back into a field the moment it is focused.
//
// MEASURED, AND MEASURED AGAINST send RATHER THAN AGAINST A COLOUR. Asked for as
// "white like send"; send is not white, it is a translucent grey that reads light
// on a dark page and stays right on a light one. Pinning a hex would pass while
// the two drifted apart, and would be wrong in one theme — which is exactly what
// these inputs looked like before anyone styled them, unstyled and browser-white.
// So the assertion is that the chip and the button match, whatever they are.
