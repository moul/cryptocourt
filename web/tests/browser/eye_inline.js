// THE EYE SITS IN THE LINE, IT DOES NOT TAKE ONE.
//
// The reset at the top of index.html is `img,svg{display:block}`, which is right
// for every picture on the site and wrong for the one glyph that is drawn rather
// than typed. An <svg> dropped straight into a line of text becomes a block and
// takes a line of its own: the set page's heading rendered the eye above the
// name, two lines where there is one thing. Reported on a live set page.
//
// THE MARK IS A CHARACTER NOW, and this check follows it rather than the SVG it
// used to be. Where a set's mark is a statement — a title, a row, a heading — it
// prints U+13080 in an embedded face (.wedjat) so a reader can select and paste
// it; only the filter's two-state control is still drawn (.eye), because its
// shut half has no codepoint and both halves must be one drawing. Both selectors
// are accepted here: what this file measures is that the mark sits IN the line
// rather than taking one, which is true of either form and is the defect it was
// written for.
// Every other surface wraps it — .setmark in a title, .id in a row, .foldbox in
// the selector — so the bug was invisible until the one unwrapped case shipped.
// That makes it a CLASS, not an incident, so this checks every eye a page draws
// rather than the heading that was reported.
