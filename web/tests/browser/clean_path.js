// A URL SOMEBODY TYPES BY HAND HAS TO LAND SOMEWHERE REAL.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT WAS REPORTED AS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY. "Typing in
// the chat at kourt.xyz/covid doesn't work anymore." Every part of the chat was
// working: the service accepted a POST, the panel mounted, Enter sent, the text
// survived a poll cycle, and forty consecutive posts in the access log were 200.
//
// The URL was the bug. nginx serves index.html for any path it has no file for,
// so /covid answered 200 with the whole application in it — and render() reads
// location.hash, which was empty, so it matched "/" and drew the DIRECTORY.
// Measured on the live site: panel:false, input:false. There was no chat box on
// that page. Nothing was broken; the reader was never on the court.
//
// THAT CLASS OF BUG IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY OTHER CHECK HERE. route_crawl follows
// the links the application itself draws, and the application only ever draws
// hash URLs — so the one URL shape a human invents is the one nothing visited.
//
// MEASURED BY BREAKING IT:
//   removing the adopt block      /covid draws the directory: both court arms fail
//   dropping the routes.some()    /diag becomes #/c/diag, an unknown court
//   adopting any path             /m/deadbeef becomes #/c/m/deadbeef
//   using location.replace        the typed URL stays in history (arm below)
