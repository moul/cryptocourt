// WHERE THE DETAILS TRIGGER LANDS, measured rather than read. It reads "see details"
// now; the arrow went with the line described below, since an arrow is this page's
// mark for leaving and a dialog does not leave.
//
// It was written at the end of the "You pay" value — after "µGNOT/unit · 0.4%
// voice" — which is fine at 1280px and falls apart at 390px: the value wraps
// across four lines and the link ends up on one of its own, roughly 120px below
// the Buy button it belongs beside. Reported as: it should be next to the
// button, or short enough to fit.
//
// That value is gone entirely now — merged into the dialog, which already carried
// both its figures verbatim — so the wrap that started this cannot recur. The
// measurements stay: what they actually pin is that the trigger sits with the button
// rather than in whatever block happens to precede it, and that is a property of the
// layout and not of the line that used to be there.
//
// A source test cannot see this. The markup is one string either way; what
// changed is which flex container the button is in, and only a laid-out page can
// say whether the two ended up side by side. Same argument rowscope_layout.js
// makes about `.line`.
//
// Measured at the narrow width because that is the one that broke. Desktop is
// asserted too, so a fix that only helps mobile — or one that fixes mobile by
// stacking the row everywhere — is caught.
