// A badge for rooms that are talking, on pages that are not the room.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Asked for as "when there is new chat activity even when i'm
// not on the chat page, show something (a bubble w/ number?) live so i know
// there are people talking" — and the poller that was already here could not
// answer it. railChatFor picks a slug only on /c/, /raw/ and /here, so on the
// directory or About there was no row, no poll, and nothing to show.
//
// THE ROOMS ARE PLANTED, NOT BORROWED. Every arm below drives a synthetic
// payload through request interception. The first cut of this test ran against
// the live service and reported no bubbles — correctly, because the live rooms
// had been quiet for a day, which means it would have passed just as happily
// against a poller that did nothing at all. A badge whose number is a function
// of the payload has to be tested by controlling the payload.
//
// ABLATED, AND ONLY WHAT WAS ACTUALLY RUN IS CLAIMED. Removing the
// railChatMarkSeen from railChatPoll fails "opening the room clears its badge"
// with bedford still at 3 — and the About total with it, at 4 instead of 1, which
// is the same defect seen from the other end. Returning [] instead of
// CHATPULSEKNOWN when the rail names no court fails the About arm alone, with no
// total at all.
//
// NOT COVERED, and an earlier version of this comment claimed it was: the wiring
// from navTrail to chatPulseSoon. wake() below calls that entry point directly,
// so cutting navTrail's call leaves every arm here green. That wiring is the fix
// for the first bug this feature had — a sweep that ran before the court rows
// existed and polled nothing — and it is the gap in this file.
