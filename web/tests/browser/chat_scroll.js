// THE CHAT OPENS AT THE NEWEST MESSAGE, which it sometimes did not.
//
// Reported as "sometimes the chat doesn't scroll down to the latest message upon
// loading". Sometimes is the whole diagnosis: paintLog only scrolled when it
// judged the reader to be at the foot already, and it judged that from
// scrollHeight and clientHeight — which are BOTH ZERO if the first transcript
// arrives before the panel has been laid out. `0 - 0 - 0 < 24` is true, so it
// set scrollTop to a scrollHeight of 0, and once layout happened the reader was
// looking at the top of the thread with nothing left to retry the scroll.
//
// WHY A BROWSER, AND WHY THIS SHAPE. The bug is entirely about the order of
// layout and paint, so it cannot be reproduced without a layout engine, and it
// cannot be reproduced by simply loading the page either — on a fast local load
// the panel is usually laid out in time, which is exactly why the report said
// "sometimes". So the condition is forced: the log is given no height, the
// transcript is painted into it, and only then is the height restored. That is
// the same sequence as a slow first paint, made deterministic.

     had moved away from the foot. So it measured its own interference and failed
