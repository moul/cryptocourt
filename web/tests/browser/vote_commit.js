// The vote-commitment line tells a voter what their vote would commit.
//
// THE BUG THIS STANDS OVER, and it shipped because the formatter was tested and
// the WIRING was not. fillVoteCommitment read w[1] from ClaimVoteWeightOf —
// the QUALITY weight — and voteLockFigures only emits "this vote would commit
// N" when that figure is above zero. Nothing assigns quality any more, so the
// second return is always 0, so the sentence never rendered: for anybody, on
// any claim, on the live site. The one number a voter wants before voting was
// silently absent, and the comment at the call site asserted the opposite —
// "nothing on the page would look wrong if this read the other one".
//
// votelock_test.js covers voteLockFigures thoroughly, including that a zero is
// omitted rather than printed as 0. It cannot catch this: its source slice ends
// at `async function fillVoteCommitment(`, so the formatter is pinned and the
// argument handed to it is not. A pure function tested in isolation says
// nothing about the value its only caller passes.
//
// SO THIS CHECKS THE WIRING, in a browser, by answering the chain read with a
// verdict weight and a zero quality weight — the shape the realm actually
// returns today — and requiring the rendered sentence to carry the verdict
// figure. Reverting the index to w[1] makes the sentence disappear, which is
// the failure the arm is for.
//
// window.fetch is the stub seam: the overlay's read helpers are all `const`,
// and puppeteer request interception never sees a cross-origin fetch from a
// file:// page (measured zero posts). Everything above fetch is real — the
// envelope decode, parseTyped's tuple split, the formatter, the DOM write.
//
// THE PANEL IS A FIXTURE, and it has to be. #votecommit lives inside the
// dispute explainer's "What casting costs you" section, which renders only
// while a verdict vote is open — and no claim in the sample carries an open
// dispute, so neither demo nor a stubbed live page produces the element. The
// span is created here and fillVoteCommitment is called directly on it, which
// is the function under test; where the span sits on the page is not. This is
// the same reason verdict_notice.js renders its own panel.
//
// ABLATED against a CONTROL run of the unmodified page, which fires nothing:
//   - index back to w[1]                -> 1: the sentence arm. The panel goes
//     empty, which is exactly what a reader saw before this was fixed.
//   - swap the stub's two values, so quality carries the figure and verdict is
//     0 -> 1: the same arm, confirming it reads position 0 and not "whichever
//     number happens to be non-zero".
// Mutations run against a COPY outside the repo: a second session edits this
// file, and an in-place mutation has been written back from a stale buffer once.
