// Opening a set on the map, in a real browser.
//
// WHY THIS NEEDS A BROWSER AND THE SOURCE HARNESS DOES NOT COVER IT.
// mapreveal_test.js runs subtreeOf/revealed/defaultReveal over a fake layout and
// proves the ARITHMETIC. It cannot prove that the arithmetic reaches the screen:
// the marks are <text> nodes rewritten by paint(), the dimming is a class on
// nodes paint() also owns, and put() replaces the whole SVG underneath both.
//
// THAT GAP HAS ALREADY BITTEN ONCE, in this same corner of the file. A filter
// retarget keyed a toggle on `.eyeopen`, a class the set rows do not carry — the
// open eye vanished from the page and all fifty-three source harnesses stayed
// green, because every one of them asserts a shape in the source rather than a
// pixel on the screen. It was found by a probe that happened to return null.
//
// So the three things measured here are the three that only exist at runtime:
//   1. the map opens with something revealed, when the court filed a 𓂀 set;
//   2. clicking a set reveals its contents, and re-clicking puts them back;
//   3. the mark on the set swaps between 𓂀 and 𓁼 AND THE PUPIL DOES NOT MOVE —
//      which is a measurement of two glyphs' baselines in the real font and is
//      not answerable from the source at all.
//
// NOTHING HERE HARDCODES A COURT OR A SET. The docket is seeded data that
// changes; the check finds a court that actually has a set on its map and skips
// cleanly if none does, because a check that fails when the demo data is
// reshaped teaches people to ignore it.

        WHY THE OBVIOUS PROBES ALL MISS IT.
          - getBBox() on SVG <text> returns the FONT's line box, not the ink: 𓂀
            and 𓁼 report byte-identical top and height, so it cannot see the mark
            move at all.
          - The middle of the INKED BOX is wrong for 𓂀, which hangs a tail well
            below the eye — centring the box puts the tail in the middle and
            lifts the eye out of it. That is the fix that shipped and was
            reported again.
          - Correlating the two glyphs' ink profiles finds the shift that best
            overlays their MASS, which is dragged by that same tail.
        SO FIND THE PUPIL ITSELF. Rendered at 400px and flood-filled inward from
        the border, each glyph gives up its ENCLOSED regions — and both contain
        the same round hole, aspect ratio 1.01, which is the pupil. Its centre is
