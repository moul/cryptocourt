// ON A PHONE THE MAP IS THE PAGE, and it was a sliver.
//
// REPORTED: "on the mobile phone the map should appear much larger... its
// height is a sliver". MEASURED at 390x844 before the fix: the svg was 176px
// tall, a fifth of the screen, with the card taking 80 of the 270 the holder had
// been given.
//
// WHY IT COLLAPSED, because the fix only makes sense against the cause. .maphold
// is a grid that takes its height from `flex:1` on a parent that fills the
// viewport. That works while the two columns sit side by side; below 860 the
// grid becomes ONE column, so the map and the card become two ROWS dividing
// whatever the holder resolved to — and on a narrow screen that was 270px.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS GUARDS, and they pull against each other, which is the whole
// reason it is worth a test:
//
//	the map must be LARGE — a definite share of the viewport, not a share of
//	  whatever is left over
//	the card must still be READABLE when a node is tapped — the first attempt
//	  took the map to 62vh and left the card 26px tall holding 184 characters,
//	  because a taller map came straight out of the card's row
//
// A test that checked only the first would have passed that broken state.

     carries touch-action:none — the browser runs no gesture of its own — and
     the only zoom in the page was the wheel. A phone has no wheel.
     AND IT WAS WORSE THAN INERT: the first of two fingers drove the
     single-finger drag, so a pinch PANNED. Measured before the fix, a spread
     took the viewBox from `422.15 368.22 339.69 251.56` to
     `357.54 368.22 339.69 251.56` — x moved, width and height did not.
     SO EVERY ARM HERE READS WIDTH, NOT THE VIEWBOX STRING. The first version of

  /* ---- AND THE CARD CAN BE REACHED ------------------------------------------
     Reported as "on the mobile i can zoom now but i can't scroll down to see
     the selected info", and the phone layout's own comment says what was meant
     to happen: "the page scrolls, which is the right behaviour on a phone: tap
     a node, then read". Nothing scrolled.
     TWO THINGS WERE WRONG AND THE FIRST FIX FOUND NEITHER. .mapfull is
     position:fixed at inset:0, so the DOCUMENT's scroll cannot move it —
     measured, window.scrollTo(0,100) took scrollY to 100 and left the card at
     the same 634px from the top of the screen — and with overflow-y:visible the
     holder was not a scroll container either, so its own scrollTop read back 0
     after being set to 100. 1159px of content in an 844px box, reachable by no
     gesture at all.
     SO BOTH ARE ASSERTED: that the holder can scroll, and that selecting brings
     the card into view. The second was written twice before it worked —
     scrollIntoView({block:"nearest"}) moved nothing because the card's top edge
     was already on screen, and window.scrollBy moved a document that the fixed
