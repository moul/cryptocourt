// YOU DO NOT BUY. YOU BURN, AND YOU RECEIVE.
//
// The owner's call, and the register is a burnt offering: GNOT goes one way to a
// keyless address and the coin comes back. "Buy" carries a seller, a price and a
// way out at that price, and there is none of the three.
//
// MEASURED ON THE RENDERED PAGE, not grepped from the source. The word survives
// legitimately in the file — `Buy` is the realm's entrypoint, and the gnokey
// command this page prints has to name it — so a file-level rule like the one
// dispute_test.js holds over "money" would fail on a true sentence. What matters
// is what a reader sees, so that is what is read: the visible text of the pages
// where coin changes hands, with <pre>/<code> excluded because a command is a
// literal, not copy.
