//
// Asked for as "make it sound a bell when someone says !?" — so the trigger is a
// thing a reader TYPES when they mean "look at this", rather than every arrival.
// A bell on every message is a bell nobody keeps switched on.
//
// WHY A BROWSER CHECK. The sound is synthesised — two oscillators through a gain
// envelope, because the overlay may not fetch an audio file — and none of that
// exists outside a document. AudioContext is stubbed here so a ring can be
// COUNTED rather than heard; the stub records what was started, which is the only
// observable a headless run has.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, said plainly. The ring is wired into the poll's paint
// path and fires for messages past the last id drawn, skipping your own and the
// opening read of a room. Reproducing that needs a live service and a growing
// transcript, so those three conditions are asserted against the SOURCE below
// rather than by arrival. A future change that keeps the source shape and breaks
// the behaviour would pass here.
