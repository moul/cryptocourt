// The share panel and the embed routes — Kourt's answer to Polymarket's
// embeddable market and its share card.
//
// WHY THESE ASSERTIONS AND NOT OTHERS. Polymarket gets both halves from
// servers this page does not have: a separate embed host, and a per-market
// og:image minted on request. The equivalents here are a ROUTE in the same
// file and a canvas drawn in the reader's own browser. That substitution has
// exactly three ways to go wrong, and each one is a test below:
//
//   1. A RELATIVE embed src. The snippet is pasted onto someone else's page,
//      where a relative URL resolves against THEIR host and the iframe shows
//      their 404. It must be absolute, and derived from where this page is.
//   2. A DIRTY base. Copy the snippet while sitting on `?theme=dark#/c/x/1`
//      and a naive base carries both, so every embed anyone pastes is pinned
//      to the sharer's theme and route.
//   3. A THEME parameter trusted into the DOM. `?theme=` is attacker-supplied
//      the moment a snippet is pasted anywhere, and it reaches
//      setAttribute("data-theme", …).
