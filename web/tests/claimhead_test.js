// The packed claim record, read back.
//
// WHY THIS HARNESS. ClaimHead is thirty-nine tab-separated columns read BY
// POSITION, which is the fastest wire format and the most dangerous one: a
// column inserted in the realm and not here does not fail, it slides every field
// after it into the wrong variable. A bond becomes a deadline, a verdict becomes
// a draw slice, and the page renders confidently and wrongly. Nothing in a
// screenshot shows it.
//
// The realm side has its own guard — claimhead_test.gno compares every column
// against the single reader it replaces. This is the other half: that the
// overlay maps those columns onto the names the claim page uses, and that it
// refuses rather than guesses when the record is not the shape it expects.
