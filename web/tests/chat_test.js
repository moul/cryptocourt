// Harness for web/chat.js — the court chat panel.
//
// Unlike its neighbours this one does not slice index.html. chat.js is a whole file
// of its own, so it is evaluated whole, which means these tests exercise the shipped
// code rather than a fragment of it and they keep working while the page is being
// edited by somebody else.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. The panel renders text written by anonymous strangers, and
// the server deliberately does not strip markup from it (SanitizeBody preserves what
// a reader sees so that the classifier reads the same thing). Escaping here is
// therefore the only thing between a message body and script execution. Most of what
// follows is that one property, approached from several directions, plus the two
// regressions found while writing it: a status repaint that erased the transcript,
// and a poller that outlived the DOM it was writing to.

     MEASURED THROUGH THE LIVE UI BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING: the row was still on
     screen 2s after /delete and gone by 8s. So the withdrawal always worked —
     what failed was the repaint, and the reader's next message is what made it
     visible, which is exactly the "replaced with something else" they saw.
     WHY IT WAITED. The submit handler already called tick() straight away, but a
     poll holds for CHATHOLD seconds until something NEWER than `seen` exists,
     and hiding a row creates no new id. The server's wake cannot save it either:
     it fires while the POST is being answered, before that poll has subscribed.
     So the read blocked for the full hold and only then painted the window.
     THE ASSERTION IS ON THE `wait` PARAMETER OF THE READ THAT FOLLOWS, not on
     the log's contents — the stub decides what the log says next, so a content
     assertion would pass on a build that still held for six seconds. The URL is

     being in the room — and it is unreachable from the browser harness, because
