// sat behind the cursor and was gone before a slow reader reached it, and no
// assertion anywhere said where it lived or how long it lasted. Both of those
// are structural facts about the markup, which is exactly what a source-slice
// harness can hold.

// THE TWO PROPERTIES, and they fail in different directions: put back inside the
// wrap it becomes unreachable, and put back on a timer it becomes unfindable.
