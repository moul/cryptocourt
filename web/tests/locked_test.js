// A LOCKED page ignores a chain saved in the browser.
//
// WHY IT IS ITS OWN HARNESS. Measured on kourt.xyz: the deployed page was reading
// http://127.0.0.1:26657 and printing it into the gnokey command it offers, while
// the wallet was correctly on the deployed chain and therefore refused to
// establish. The cause was a saved config from an earlier visit to the repo copy
// on the same origin — cleanCfg starts from CFG_DEFAULTS and lets stored values
// override them — and LOCKED hides the source panel, so nothing on screen could
// show it or undo it.
//
// That is the exact hazard the LOCKED comment names, "a way to point a production
// page at somebody else's node and then read the result as if it were this
// court", arriving through localStorage rather than through the panel it guards.

// lines, which is what makes this worth testing on both settings.
//
// THE CUT STARTS AT ADDR_RE, NOT AT cleanCfg. cleanCfg validates two address
// fields against a shared top-level const, and a slice that began at the
// function left it closing over nothing: "ADDR_RE is not defined", at the first
// call, in a harness whose subject is a config that survives a deploy.
