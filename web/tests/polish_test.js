// WHY THIS EXISTS. The realm has let an author fix a claim's title since it was
// written — before the first stake, before the opening delay passes, author
// only. Nothing in the product called it. A sweep of crossing entrypoints
// against the two shipped web files found it among nine others, and it is the
// one that mattered most for a reason the others did not share: THE WINDOW
// EXPIRES. A feature the product cannot reach is missing; a timed one the
// product cannot reach is missing and then gone.
//
// So the offer has to appear while it can still succeed and vanish when it
// cannot, and every "vanish" below is a case where showing it would send an
// author to a form the realm is going to refuse.
