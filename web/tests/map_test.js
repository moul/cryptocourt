//
// THE MAP WENT RADIAL, so the invariants moved with it. What the old set checked
// was a grid: folders were nested BOXES, claims were rows inside them, and every
// edge was routed through channel lanes and a horizontal bus so no line crossed
// anything. Three of its nine checks were about that machinery — folders
// nested-or-disjoint, claims inside folders, distinct lanes and bus tracks — and
// none of them means anything now that a folder is a node with claims hung around
// it. They are replaced by the two things the new layout actually promises:
//
//   A  every node pair — court, folder, claim alike — disjoint by ≥4u
//   B  each label inside the node that owns it
//   C  no two labels overlap
//   E  every folder and claim is REACHED by a containment spoke (connectivity,
//      which is what "claims inside folders" was really asserting)
//   F  a phase dot sits inside its claim and clear of that claim's text
//   G  a SPOKE crosses no node it does not end on. Chords are exempt BY DESIGN:
//      a direct line between two claims cannot promise that, chords are drawn
//      under the nodes for exactly that reason, and a check that demanded it
//      would re-invent the bus.
//   I  everything inside the viewBox
//
// G also needed a real segment/rect test. The old one returned `true` for any
// segment that was not axis-aligned — fine when every edge was orthogonal, and
// useless here, where it would have reported every spoke as hitting every node.

  /* A SPARSE SUBTREE IS NOT EXILED BY A CROWDED ONE THAT SHARES ITS DEPTH.
     Radius is a property of a sibling group, not of a depth: under one radius per
     ring, a ring can only be as tight as its worst wedge, so two claims got flung
     out to wherever twenty needed to be. On the real covid docket that cost
     392px — "The iPhone texts" sat at r=1040 with three claims because
     "Gain-of-function funding" happened to share its depth.
     Groups may move independently because angular sectors are DISJOINT: two
     boxes in non-overlapping sectors cannot touch at any pair of radii, and the
     only pair that can collide is a parent and its own descendant, which the
     clearance term bounds from the parent's real radius.
     THE FIXTURE IS ITS OWN, AND IT HAS TO BE NESTED AND LOPSIDED. `deep` was
     used first and quietly stopped discriminating when the claim box was
     re-proportioned: with taller boxes the CLEARANCE term dominates both groups
     and they land within 4px of each other, so the assertion passed on both the
     right and the wrong layout. Measured over candidate shapes, and worth
     recording because it says where this effect lives:

       A=7  B=2 nested   per-group 592/592     no separation at all
       A=14 B=2 nested   per-group 655/643     12px, still not a guard
       A=20 B=1 nested   per-group 900/600     300px  <-- this one
       A=14 B=2 flat     per-group 581/581     no separation
       A=20 B=2 flat     per-group 792/792     no separation

     FLAT DOCKETS NEVER SEPARATE, which is not a defect in the fixture but the
     shape of the thing: a folder's angular share is already proportional to how
     many leaves it carries, so at one level down every group needs the same
     radius and per-depth is accidentally correct. The win only exists BELOW a
     subfolder, where a group inherits an angular share sized for its parent's
     whole subtree — which is exactly where the covid docket lost its 392px.
     ONE ASSERTION, AND TWO MORE I WROTE AND THREW AWAY. The others were "a
     sibling group sits on one arc" and "a claim sits outside its folder". Both
     are true and neither could be armed: breaking the code they describe — per
     node wedge bounds for the first, clearance measured from the ring instead of
     from the parent for the second — left them green, because the overlap and
     containment invariants above already fail on those mutations. An assertion no
     mutation can turn red guards nothing; it just reads as though it does. */
