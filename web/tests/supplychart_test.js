// The court page's one graph: GNOT burned into this court over time.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. It reads a wire format the realm defines (BurnSeries in
// realm/r/kourtv2/supplyseries.gno) and turns it into a path. Both halves drift
// silently: a grammar change makes the parser return null and the graph just
// disappears, and a maths slip draws a line that is wrong rather than absent.
// Neither shows up as an error in a browser.
//
// ONE GRAPH, NOT THREE. Price and supply are figures; burn is the one worth a
// shape, because it is the one nobody can fake.
//
// THE STEP IS THE POINT. Every series holds flat between events and jumps at
// one, so the path must be hold-then-jump. Joining the change points directly
// would draw a gradual slope that never happened — the graph would be claiming
// a history the chain does not have.
//
// BLANK RATHER THAN A FLAT LINE. A court with no history draws nothing, because
// a zero line reads as "no growth" when the truth is "nothing has happened
// yet". The box keeps its height so the three tiles stay level.
//
// ENDPOINTS ARE DRAWN. A flat run is the common case, and without both ends
// marked it reads as a stray rule across the tile rather than as a value that
// has held since a known point.
