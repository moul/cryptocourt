// "does it render" but "is it the SAME cover every time" — a court whose colour
// changed between reloads would be worse than no cover at all, and a screenshot
// of one page can never show it. The fill is the other half: one read for a
// whole directory page, parsed on a tab, where a court with no picture is absent
// from the reply rather than present-and-empty.
