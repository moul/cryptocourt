     icon "like starlight constellation routes".
     Source assertions, because this harness has no browser — the GEOMETRY (that
     it lands right of the seal, on the same line) is measured in the deploy
     screenshot rather than here, and this side pins the things a rename or a
     tidy-up would break: that the link is inside the h1 at all, and that the old
     paragraph is gone.

     THE ARROW CAME BACK, and this assertion used to forbid it. Reported as "map
     doesn't have an arrow" on /c/covid/f/4.
     The original request was to replace an arrow-ONLY affordance with the map's
     mark, and that reading held while this was the only jump of its kind. It
     stopped holding when the claim page grew the same jump and settled the house
     style at icon-noun-arrow — d3_test names it "the shared convention" and pins
     `${ICN_CONSTEL}map<span` there. So the two map links in this app read
     differently for no reason a reader could see, and the folder one was the odd
