"""Reading Gno source the way a guard needs to read it.

Not a guard. A guard is `check-*.py`, is named in selftest-checks.py, and is run
by a target; this is a library three of them share, the way repolock.py is.

WHY IT EXISTS. strip_comments was written three times in one sitting -- in
check-interrealm, check-getcoins and check-inert-flags -- and the three copies
had ALREADY diverged before anybody read them together: two spelled the quote
set `"\\"'`"` and the third `'"\\'`'`. That divergence happened to be cosmetic.
The next one would not announce itself, and a guard that mis-reads a comment as
code fails in the direction that looks like success.

def strip_comments(src):
    """Comment text out, code left in place, string literals respected.

    WITHOUT THIS A GUARD READS PROSE AS CODE, and every guard here has been
    caught by it. kourtv1/buy.gno carries the sentence "flags is
    unsafe.PreviousRealm (which skips frame verification) -- NOT this", a
    comment saying the code does NOT do the thing, which a naive scan reported
    as doing the thing. buy.gno documents the GetCoins rule in a comment that
    names GetCoins. And "Unequal on purpose:" in a test reads as a
    composite-literal write of a field called `purpose`.

    STRING LITERALS ARE TRACKED, NOT MERELY SKIPPED. A `//` inside a quoted URL
    would otherwise swallow the rest of the line, hiding real code from the
    guard -- and that failure is SILENT, which is the one direction a guard must
    never fail in. Raw backtick strings take no escapes, hence the `q != "`"`.
