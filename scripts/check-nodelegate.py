"""Trip if kourtv2 gains delegation while its vote weight is floored by own balance.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Vote weight in kourtv2 is

    w = min( PastVotes(who, Q), BalanceOf(who) )

and those two readings are NOT the same quantity in general. `PastVotes` is
delegation-aware — grc20votes credits an account with every balance delegated to
it — while `BalanceOf` is strictly the address's own coin. Today the two agree in
kourtv2 for one reason and one only: **kourtv2 exposes no way to delegate**, so
every account is self-delegated and `PastVotes(who, Q)` is exactly who's own past
balance.

The moment kourtv2 exposes delegation, the ceiling starts counting coin the voter
was lent the say over while the floor counts only coin they hold, so **every
delegatee is silently docked to their own balance** — a delegate holding nothing
and trusted with a million votes gets zero. Nothing else in the tree would
complain: the arithmetic stays coherent, every suite stays green, and the loss is
invisible until somebody who delegated wonders why their delegate cannot vote.

That is a comment-shaped hazard, so it gets a machine instead of a comment.

WHY r/govern IS EXEMPT, stated rather than assumed. govern exposes Delegate and
shares the same governor engine, but it calls `Vote`, which applies no cap and
therefore no floor. Delegation and the floor only collide where both are present.
If govern ever adopts VoteWithCap, this guard's scope has to grow with it — which
is what arm 4 is for.
