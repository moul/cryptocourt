"""An abort assertion must not be satisfiable by a layer it is not testing.

THE BUG THAT PRODUCED THIS CHECK. TransferCC and TransferFromCC both open

    if amount <= 0 { panic("kourtv2: transfer amount must be positive") }

and both had a test passing 0 and asserting AbortsContains(..., "must be
positive"). That reads like the guard is pinned. It was not: grc20votes carries
its own mustBePositive panicking "grc20votes: amount must be positive", so the
substring is satisfied by EITHER layer. An operator sweep flipped both guards to
`< 0` and reported SURVIVED, and the measurement says why — with the realm guard
weakened, a zero-amount transfer still aborts:

    panic: grc20votes: amount must be positive

Two rows that looked unpinnable became caught the moment the assertions named
the realm's own full message. Nothing about the realm changed.

THE RULE. An assertion is ambiguous when its substring is contained in BOTH a
kourtv2 panic message AND a panic message in a p/ package kourtv2 imports. Both
halves are required, and the second one is what keeps this usable:

  - "allowance exceeded" is produced ONLY by grc20votes. kourtv2 delegates
    allowance enforcement to the ledger, so asserting the ledger's message is
    correct, not ambiguous. No kourtv2 competitor, no finding.
  - kourtv1 and ccwrap also share messages with kourtv2 by the dozen — they are
    its ancestor and its wrapper — but the kourtv2 suite never calls into them,
    so those pairs cannot fool any assertion here. Only IMPORTED packages count.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK, because the check would be worse than the
gap. A substring can also be loose WITHIN kourtv2: measured at the time of
writing, 46 assertions match more than one kourtv2 panic message, "moderator"
matching fifteen of them. Almost all are harmless — the other messages are not
reachable from the call under assertion — and a check reporting 46 findings
against a correct tree is the kind of nuisance that gets switched off, which
would cost more than it saves. The cross-layer rule is the one with a
demonstrated failure behind it, and it sits at zero.

If this fires: name the full message of the guard you are testing, including its
"kourtv2:" prefix. If you genuinely mean to assert the inner layer's refusal,
assert the inner layer's full message instead — and then no kourtv2 message
matches it, so this check goes quiet on its own.
