"""No height read in the realm may bypass heightNow().

WHY THIS IS A GUARD AND NOT A CONVENTION. The test clock overrides height as
well as wall-clock, so a test chain can advance conviction, emission, vote
windows and twap maturity without mining. That works only if EVERY read goes
through the shim. Miss one and a single transaction sees two different heights
— a claim opened at fabricated height 20,000 while the twap ring observes at
real height 30 — which is corrupt state, not a display bug.

There were 65 call sites across 15 files when this was written. Nobody is going
to re-check them by eye, and the next person to add a height read will reach for
`runtime.ChainHeight()` because that is what the rest of gno does.

Two files are allowed to hold the raw read, and only those:
  clock.gno     — defines heightNow(), the shim itself
  testclock.gno — the latch that computes the skew, and must see REAL height

IT ALSO GUARDS THE PURE PACKAGES, because an audit found the guard proved less
than it claimed. `p/grc20votes` keeps a nil-clock fallback to `ChainHeight()` so
other realms can use it unchanged — which means a ledger built with `NewLedger`
instead of `NewLedgerWithClock` reads REAL height while the claims, twap rings
and checkpoints in the same transaction read fabricated height. Today kourtv2
constructs exactly one ledger and passes a clock; that was convention, not a
guard. It is a guard now.
