# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT AN EDIT. A Gno import path is a compile-time
# literal: `gno.land/p/kourt/curve/v0` cannot be parameterised at deploy time.
# gnomod.toml's [[replace]] looks like the answer and is not — it redirects an
# import to a LOCAL path for development and makes addpkg fail on-chain, so it
# must be stripped before deploying. That leaves rewriting the literals, and a
# rewrite done by hand is a rewrite done differently each time.
#
# The repo keeps ONE canonical path (gno.land/{p,r}/kourt/...). This writes a
# retargeted tree beside it; nothing in the working copy is touched.

# ON PEARL THE NAMESPACE MUST BE THE ADDRESS. Namespace enforcement is on there
# and the public registrar only sells names matching nym-[a-z]{5,13}\d{3}, so
# `kourt` cannot be registered — but r/<your-g1address>/* is authorized on every
# chain with no registration at all.

# storage deposit to keep on chain, and they are the only files here that name
# paths this rewrite deliberately does not touch — the `// PKGPATH:` directives
# of sibling filetest packages, and NewCodeRealm("…/notacourt"), which is meant

# Every literal, in sources AND in each gnomod.toml `module` line. The realm's

# that does not match where the realm actually lives derives an escrow address
# nobody controls.
# The patterns are deliberately NOT anchored on "gno.land". Render() emits
# markdown links as bare "/r/kourt/kourtv2:how-it-works" with no domain, and an
# anchored rewrite silently leaves every one of them pointing at the old path —
# the realm deploys and renders fine, and every internal link 404s. Matching the
# bare form covers the qualified form too, since the domain is just a prefix.

# An earlier version of this script left it alone, reasoning that a package name
# is a Go identifier and a g1 address is not a legal one — true of the NAMESPACE
# segment, irrelevant to the last element, and `gno lint` said so immediately.
# The libraries are unaffected: their paths end in /v0 and gno matches against
# the element before the version.

# A WORKSPACE, so the tree resolves against itself. Without gnowork.toml each
# directory is in single-package mode: it resolves stdlib and its own files, and
# an import of a sibling is looked for in $GNOHOME/pkg/mod — so `gno lint` tries
# to DOWNLOAD gno.land/p/<ns>/checkpoint/v0 from a chain that does not have it
# yet and fails on a package sitting in the next directory. The toolchain matches
# by the declared `module` path, not by directory name, which is why this works
# with the layout as copied.
# It is a local build artifact and is not deployed — addpkg uploads one package
# directory at a time and never sees this file.
