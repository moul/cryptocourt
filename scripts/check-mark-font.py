"""Every set mark the page draws must wear the class that carries its font.

THE GLYPH IS NOT IN A SYSTEM FONT ON MOST MACHINES. U+13080 and U+1307C are
Egyptian hieroglyphs; macOS ships a face that has them and most other systems do
not. So the overlay embeds a subsetted woff2 as a data URI and applies it through
`.wedjat` — and a mark drawn WITHOUT that class renders as a tofu box for the
majority of readers while looking perfect to everyone who works on it.

MEASURED, WHICH IS WHY THIS EXISTS. On kourt.xyz the map drew its marks as
`text.mset.wedjat` and computed wedjat-font, while the chat panel drew
`span.chatmark` and computed -apple-system. Same glyph, two surfaces, one of them
silently broken for everyone without an Egyptian font installed. It was found by
hand; nothing would have caught the next one.

SCOPE, STATED NARROWLY, AND IT WORKS BACKWARDS. It finds a MARK in web/index.html
or web/chat.js — as a `\\u{...}` escape, a literal glyph, a template hole that IS
the mark, or one concatenated onto a string — and then walks back to the nearest
opening span or text, requiring `wedjat` among its classes.

THAT DIRECTION IS THE POINT, and it was learned the hard way. Scanning FORWARDS
from a tag missed a real site three times, because these files build markup by
concatenation and interpolation: a tag and the glyph it wraps routinely live in
different expressions, with a <title> child or a string boundary in between.

A BARE `const SET_MARK` and a test fixture never reach an opening tag and drop out
on their own. COMMENTS ARE SKIPPED EXPLICITLY, which is not the same thing — they
used to drop out by accident, until a comment explaining this very rule mentioned
a <text> and the escape within a few lines of each other and was read as markup.

AND IT CHECKS THE CLASS STILL DOES ITS JOB, because "every mark wears .wedjat" is
worth nothing if .wedjat stops naming the font. Both halves, or this passes while
every mark on the site is a box.

# THE FOUR WAYS A MARK REACHES MARKUP, and the fourth is why this file has a
# mutation test. `\u{...}` and the literal glyph are what they look like. The third

# is not there to see. The fourth is CONCATENATION — `'...>' + hit.mark` — which is
# how web/chat.js builds every tag it emits, since that file has no template
# literals to spare inside its own stylesheet string.
#
# THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS GUARD MISSED THAT, and so passed cleanly against the
# exact bug it was written for: chat.js's mark stripped of `wedjat` sailed through.
# Caught by mutating the source rather than by trusting the summary line, which is
# the only way a blind spot in a scanner ever shows up.
# THE HEX IS EITHER CASE, AND THAT WAS A REAL BLIND SPOT. This read `7C` only,
# and web/index.html spells one of its two eyes `\u{1307c}` — so a mark sitting in
# a span was invisible to the whole scanner over a letter's case. Found by
# widening the pattern for something else and noticing the count move.

# The comment contains `<title>`, so `[^>]*` could not reach the real `>`, no
# opener was found within the window, and the site was SKIPPED — not failed.
# Coverage fell from 7 sites to 6 and the total still read 7, because a new site
# had just been added elsewhere. A guard that goes quiet is worse than one that

    so a mark in a `.eyeshut` span renders perfectly and a guard checking for one
    class calls it broken. Rather than keep a second list in step with the CSS,
    ask the CSS: any selector whose declarations name the face lends its classes.

    A DESCENDANT SELECTOR IS TAKEN AT ITS WORD, which is the honest limit here.
    `.foldsel .eyeshut` only applies inside `.foldsel`, and this cannot see an
    ancestor — so `.eyeshut` counts as fonted wherever it appears. Checked by
    hand today: its one draw site is inside a `.foldsel` row, and the live page
    computes wedjat-font on it. A second site outside that row would be a tofu
    box this guard waves through.

    THE STYLESHEET ONLY, WHICH COST A ROUND. Run over the whole file this also
    reads JavaScript block bodies as CSS rules, and any brace-block near the
    string "wedjat-font" lent its dotted words to the accepted set — `.org` and
    `.sil` arrived that way, two property accesses promoted to font-bearing
    classes. A guard that accepts too much is the failure mode that never shows.

    ...AND NOT THE @font-face, WHICH IS WHERE `.org` AND `.sil` CAME FROM. That
    block declares the face, so it matches on the name every time, and the text
    standing where its selector would be is the COMMENT above it — prose about
    the subsetting, with dotted words in it. Two of them became font-bearing
