"""Walk every read the overlay makes in live mode against a running node.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The demo dataset cannot surface a whole class of defect,
because its courts are mature and its numbers were chosen by hand. A freshly
seeded chain is young, poor and sparse, and that is where the page breaks: the
curve's marginal price is integer-divided, so a court under 1,000 CC served a
price of exactly 0 and the page printed "0 µGNOT/unit" — the coin is free —
while the buy panel beside it quoted a real fractional price. Nothing in the
sample could have shown that.

So this asks the node every question the page asks, and reports anything that
does not come back in the shape the page will try to parse. It is a
CONFORMANCE check against a live node, not a unit test: run it against a node
seeded by scripts/seed-node.sh.

    scripts/check-live-reads.py [--remote http://127.0.0.1:26657] [--court bedford]

It is deliberately NOT part of `make check` — that gate must not require a
running chain.
