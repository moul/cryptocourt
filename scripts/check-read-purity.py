"""An exported read must never allocate and persist state as a side effect of
being asked a question.

`mustModRead` exists precisely to state this rule: it is the READ-ONLY
counterpart of `ensureMod`, so a query that needs a court's moderation state
panics when there is none instead of creating one. Nine helpers in kourtv2 allocate
and persist, and the list is in ALLOCATORS below rather than here so it cannot
drift from what the check enforces — this sentence said "three" long after there
were more, which is the same rot the census exists to catch one level down. None
of them belongs on a read path.

WHY IT MATTERS, in the order the harm arrives:

  1. THE SAME QUESTION ANSWERS TWO WAYS. This already happened once, and the
     fix is recorded at `FolderPurged` in folders.gno: it used to return false
     for a nonexistent folder, so the answer depended on whether the court
     happened to hold any moderation state at all. A read that allocates has the
     same shape — the first caller changes what the second caller sees.
  2. UNPAID STATE GROWTH. A query is not a transaction and carries no storage
     deposit, so a read that persists a struct lets anyone grow the realm for
     free. Every other flood surface in this design is priced; this one would
     not be.
  3. A QUERY THAT WRITES IS NOT A QUERY. Reads are reached without a crossing
     call and must be safe to serve from any node at any height.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A TEST. The rule is a property of every read that exists,
including the next one somebody adds — 100 of them at the time of writing, and a
test can only ever assert it about the reads it names. The failure mode is drift:
a new read reaches for `ensureMod` because that is the helper the writes use, and
nothing in the suite notices, because allocating makes the read SUCCEED where it
should have panicked. Nothing goes red. A structural check is the only thing that
sees the whole surface.

A read is identified as an exported TOP-LEVEL function with no `cur realm`
parameter. Both halves of that matter. A crossing function takes `cur realm` and
is a write, so the parameter is the discriminator the language gives us; and a
query reaches exported top-level functions only, never a method on an internal
type. Methods are excluded deliberately, not incidentally: `dispute.gno` carries
`Check`, `Describe`, `Do` and `Name` on an internal action type implementing the
governor interface, and `Do` EXECUTES the action. It takes no `cur realm` because
the governor calls it, not a user — so counting methods would put a write on the
read list and make this check fire on correct code.

If this script ever fires, either use the `must*` read counterpart on that path
or — if the new read genuinely must allocate — say why, here, in this file.

# has to be named or the hop is a hole. It was added the moment that hop was.
# getStanding and getRecord are the same shape as getPos: each allocates its row
# and Sets it on first access, and each has a deliberate non-allocating twin
# (lookupStanding, and AnswerRecord's own inline lookup) that reads may use.
# getRecord had been unlisted since it was written — the split was held by
# discipline alone, and a read reaching it would have reported green.

EXPORTED = re.compile(r"^func ([A-Z]\w*)\(([^)]*)\)")
CROSSING = re.compile(r"\bcur\s+realm\b")

# AND AN EXPORTED READ MUST NOT HAND OUT A POINTER, which is the second half of
# the same rule and was enforced by nothing. Three places in kourtv2 cite "borrow
# rule #2" for it — court.gno on /p/ pointers, strips.gno on realm state, and
# folders.gno most explicitly, at FolderItems: "returns a copy of a folder's
# claim-ID list (a value slice — never a pointer into realm state, borrow rule
# #2)". Nothing checked that the next read keeps the promise.
#
# The harm is not a wrong answer. A pointer handed across the realm boundary is
# mutable by whoever holds it, and a write through it commits under THIS realm's
# authority, so a reader becomes a writer without a crossing call and without a
# storage deposit. That is a different and worse failure than the allocation one
# above, which only grows state.
#
# NO POINTER AT ALL is deliberately stricter than "no pointer into realm state".
# Distinguishing a freshly-allocated return from an escaping one is not something
# a static reader can do honestly, and the strict form is the property that
# actually holds: measured, ZERO of the exported reads return a pointer, while
# nine UNEXPORTED helpers do (mustClaim, mustFolder, getPos and the like) and are
# untouched by this because they never cross the boundary. A read that genuinely
# needs to return a fresh pointer goes in the allowlist with its reason, which is
# the census pattern the other guards here use.
POINTER_RETURN_OK = {}

# AND THE OTHER HALF OF POINTER DISCIPLINE: a p/ type held in realm state BY
# POINTER, which is the shape the arm above stops from ever being handed out.
#
# twap.gno states it as a property of the whole realm: the Ring "is never a heap
# object of its own, and never held by pointer in realm state: every method takes a
# Ring by value", and gives the reason — a Ring inline in a claim "costs nothing
# extra to keep, whereas a *Ring would be a second object". Nothing enforced it.
# Two consequences, not one: a second allocation per field, and borrow rule #2 if
# such a pointer ever escaped through a read, because a pointer across the realm
# boundary is mutable by its holder and the write commits under this realm's
# authority.
#
# NARROW ON PURPOSE, AND THE MEASUREMENT IS WHY. The obvious guard — "no pointer to
# a p/ type in realm state" — would be simply wrong here: kourtv2 holds 33 such
# fields and nearly all are *bptree.BPTree, which is what a tree IS, plus
# *grc20votes.Ledger, *governor.Governor and *checkpoint.Archive. Writing that
# census would have meant a 33-entry allowlist and no property. So this pins the one
# type whose own package states the claim, and nothing more.
#
# ANCHORING IS SAFE HERE, unlike the call censuses in check-epoch-coherence that
# were unanchored for missing `if pv := cs.stakers.Remove(...)`. A Go struct field
# declaration is always the start of its line; there is no mid-line form to miss.
# Do not "fix" this into a `.*` shape.
#
# THE COUNT IS 2, NOT 4, and how I got that wrong is worth the two lines. A first
# pass over every realm printed four Ring fields as `claim.gno:34, :35, :81, :82`
# and I read them as one file — but two of them are in kourtv1/claim.gno and two in
# kourtv2/claim.gno. The output was BASENAMES, so the directory that distinguished
# them was the column not printed. Same shape as `grep -h` defeating a path filter:
# confirm the instrument before believing its report. kourtv1 is behaviourally
# frozen and this guard is kourtv2-scoped by design, so its two are out of scope
# here rather than uncounted.
