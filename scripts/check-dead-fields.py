"""A struct field nothing reads or writes is storage nobody asked for.

    python3 scripts/check-dead-fields.py

WHY THIS IS NOT MERELY TIDINESS. These structs persist. A field that is written
and never read is a storage deposit paid at every write, forever, for a value no
caller can observe; a field that is neither written nor read is a claim in the
source that the realm tracks something it does not. Both mislead a reader of the
struct, which is the first thing anyone reads.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH, said plainly so nobody reads more into a pass than is
there: this finds fields mentioned NOWHERE outside their declaration. A field
that is assigned once and never read afterwards still costs the deposit, and a
name-based scan cannot tell that from a legitimate write. Use it as a floor, not
a proof.

THREE WAYS THIS SCAN WAS WRONG BEFORE IT WAS RIGHT, each of which made it report
FEWER dead fields than there were -- the failure direction that looks like a
pass:

  1. Unexported fields were searched across the whole tree, so an unrelated field
     of the same name in another realm vouched for a dead one. kourtv1's `parent`
     hid behind kourtv2's board `parent` for exactly this reason. An unexported
     field can only be touched inside its own package, so that is where to look.
  2. The struct-body walk stopped at a column-zero `}`, which a one-line
     `struct{}` never has -- so it ran on into the functions below and read
     `return out` as a field named `return`. Brace depth ends a struct; a
     guessed-at brace does not.
  3. The field pattern could not match a line with a trailing comment, because
     the type part cannot span `// 0 = top-level; a folder-claim's ...`. Every
     DOCUMENTED field was therefore skipped in silence. Fixing it took the census
     from 285 to 504 -- the scan had been ignoring nearly half the struct fields
     in the repo while reporting success.

The census floor below exists because of #3. A scan that quietly stops examining
things reports a clean tree indefinitely.
