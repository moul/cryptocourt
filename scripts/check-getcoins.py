"""The burn-sink read is GetCoins on gnoland-1, and this keeps it that way.

    python3 scripts/check-getcoins.py

INVERTED BY OWNER DECISION. This guard used to FORBID GetCoins, which is the
right rule for code that can still be deployed. buy.gno cannot: it is live on
gnoland-1 and a package deploys exactly once, so the repo now mirrors what runs
rather than a fix that can never reach it. Changing that line here would create a
divergence from production -- a DEPLOY decision, not a cleanup -- and this is
where that shows up.

THE RULE IT STILL ENFORCES, for everything else. Reading one balance is
`banker.GetCoin(addr, denom)`. `GetCoins(addr)`
reads EVERY denom the address holds, and anyone may send any address a new denom
without its consent -- so the cost of the read is set by a third party, not by
this realm. On any address an outsider can reach, that is a permanent
out-of-gas waiting for somebody to decide it should happen.

THIS IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL AND IT IS NOT HISTORY: it is live on gnoland-1 right
now. The deployed buy.gno reads

    b.GetCoins(chain.PackageAddress(burnSinkPath)).AmountOf(gnotDenom)

from BurnedGNOT(), which renderAdminParams() calls, which Render() reaches for
the `admin-params` page. And BurnSink() publishes that address on purpose, so
anybody can reconcile the burn -- which also tells an attacker precisely where
to send junk denoms to make the page cost more to read every time. The repo was
fixed to GetCoin; a package deploys exactly once, so the fix cannot reach that
path. This guard exists so the version people CAN still fix does not drift back.

TESTS ARE EXEMPT, and the distinction is the whole point rather than
convenience: a test picks its own addresses, so no stranger sets the cost. What
makes GetCoins dangerous is reachability by someone who wants it to hurt.

THE CENSUS COUNTS THE SAFE FORM, not the dangerous one. Counting GetCoins could
not tell "the realm is clean" from "the scan broke" -- both read zero. GetCoin
must be non-zero for the scan to have looked at anything at all.
