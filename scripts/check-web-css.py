"""Check that index.html's stylesheet is not silently broken.

SCOPE, STATED BECAUSE THE LAST GUARD THAT LEFT IT VAGUE COST A BUG. This reads
the <style> block in web/index.html and nothing else. The overlay ships a SECOND
stylesheet — CHATCSS in web/chat.js, 1.2KB and 19 rules, injected by chatStyles()
— and it is NOT checked here.

That is a deliberate boundary, not an oversight, and it is worth the sentence
because check-web-dupes had the same shape and was not deliberate: its docstring
said "the overlay" while it read one of the two shipped files, so a cross-file
function collision walked past it and a demo court page started calling the real
chat service (500e543, fixed in c1df426).

Why the boundary is left where it is: this script is a flat scan over one `css`
string, so a second source means restructuring it into a function — real risk to
a working guard — and two of its three checks cannot fire on CHATCSS at all,
which contains no comments. Only brace balance could, on 1.2KB. If CHATCSS grows
comments, or grows at all, that arithmetic changes and this should be a loop over
both sources rather than a note.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A `/* ... */` comment inside `.emb{}` was edited badly and left
a stray `*/` with prose in front of it. CSS error recovery then skipped forward
to the next `;` — which belonged to the declaration AFTER the comment — so
`width:100%` was swallowed and the share card sized itself shrink-to-fit. The
card came out 422px wide inside the 400px frame it exists to fit.

Nothing caught it. `make check` passed, all 16 web harnesses passed, and
`node --check` passed because the mistake was in CSS and that only parses the
script block. The stylesheet is roughly a third of the one file that IS the
product, and until now no gate read it at all.

Three things, all cheap and all things that have actually happened here:

  1. Comment markers balance. A stray `*/` or an unclosed `/*` silently eats
     declarations rather than failing.
  2. Braces balance. An unclosed rule swallows every rule after it.
  3. No declaration is left orphaned between a comment's end and a `;` — the
     specific shape of the bug above, where prose sits where a property should.

Deliberately NOT a CSS validator: unknown properties and vendor prefixes are
fine, and a check that argues about taste gets switched off. This one only
answers "does the parser see what the author wrote".

WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH, stated because a check that implies more than it tests is
worse than none. An unterminated `/*` whose swallowed region happens to contain
balanced braces is lexically indistinguishable from one long legitimate comment —
armed and confirmed: that case passes. Case 1 catches it only when the comment
eats a rule boundary. The incident this file was written for is case 3, which is
caught.
