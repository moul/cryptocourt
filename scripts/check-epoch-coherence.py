"""Trip if a vote tally and the bar it is judged against stop sharing an epoch.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A change making vote weight LIVE (the voter's balance at the
moment they vote) was built, reviewed by three panels, and reverted. It was not
killed by a bug list. It was killed because every safety bar in this realm is a
FROZEN snapshot, deliberately — "a bar cannot move under an open vote" is asserted
in four separate files — and a live numerator against a frozen denominator gave
turnout at 200-400% of its own bar in several lanes. Six sites, one root cause.

Arm 1 below fires on exactly the three lines that change did, so it would have
tripped on its first commit, before a single test ran. That is the whole point:
this class is cheap to catch lexically and expensive to catch by review.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH, stated so nobody over-trusts it. Two frozen quantities
frozen at DIFFERENT epochs (weighing a verdict at the answer's epoch while the
credential bar still reads the proposal's) are invisible to arms 1-3; that needs a
declared epoch per site, which is a convention this repo has not adopted. See
VOTELOCK.md's tension map before relying on this guard for a redesign.

# For a while these carried per-file COUNTS, because `w = min(PastVotes(who, Q),

# and every tally file went back to zero live reads. A guard that had to be
# weakened to admit a fix is now stronger than before it, which is the shape to
# aim for: the fix was not an exception to the rule, it was a missing abstraction.

#   nothing, so the shape check is the only thing between a ceiling and a floor.
#   Measured: [one-weight] fires, [live-census] does not.
#
#   CAUGHT, but by ARM 1 and not here — a second INLINE copy of the expression.
#   Any real second implementation has to read a live balance, which trips that
#   file's census. So the two arms cover it between them, and neither alone.
#
#   NOT CAUGHT — a wrapper that merely forwards, e.g. `func effectiveWeight(...)
#   { return votingWeight(...) }`. It adds no live read and does not match the
#   name family below. That is a readability problem rather than a correctness
#   one: a forwarder cannot disagree with what it forwards to. If one ever grows
#   its own arithmetic it stops forwarding, and then it needs a BalanceOf and arm
#   1 has it.
#
# The name family is deliberately a PREFIX match, so votingWeightV2 or voteCap2
# fail closed rather than sliding past — the same fail-closed shape as arm 3's
# int64 parameter allowlist.

# ARM 5 — the quality vote lock releases on "the claim is terminal", and its idea of
# terminal is `cs.verdictAt != 0 || cs.closed`. That is only correct while those two
# fields are the COMPLETE set of ways a claim can end.
#
# claim.gno says so in prose — "VERDICT_FINAL (P4): set by SettleUndisputed,
# Finalize, or provClose" — and prose is what this arm replaces. A fourth terminal
# path that ended a claim some other way would leave every quality vote cast into a
# frozen tally locked FOREVER, with no error anywhere: the predicate would simply
# keep answering "still open" about a claim that is over. Nothing else in the tree
# would notice, because nothing else asks.
#
# So the writers are counted. A change here is not necessarily wrong — it just has
# to be made by someone who has read votelock.gno's voteLockQuality arm.
# ANY assignment form, and requiring ` = ` was this arm's blind spot. Five places in
# this realm already assign cs fields in TUPLE form (answer.gno's stake freeze,
# dispute.gno's carrot record twice, quality.gno's tally reset, stake.gno's
# conviction), so `cs.verdictAt, cs.verdictAtTime = now, t` is the idiomatic way to
# write a new terminal path here — and under the old pattern an ADDED one left the
# count at three and went unseen. Converting an existing one would have fired, by
# dropping the count, which is the kind of half-coverage that reads as coverage.
#

# `verdictAt != 0 || closed`, so a new way for a claim to END that does not write
# one of those leaves every quality vote on it locked forever, silently.

# ARM 6 — mustStakable has exactly ONE caller, and that is a safety invariant.
#
# Every mustSpendable call site moves coin OUT of a holder's balance, so all of them
# respect the vote lock. Stake is the single deliberate exemption: it is a pure lock
# that leaves the coin where it is and keeps it voting, so a pending vote is no
# reason to refuse it, and it calls mustStakable instead.
#
# A SECOND caller would be a second path escaping the vote lock, and it would do so
# silently — mustStakable is a legitimate-looking helper with a reassuring name, and
# reaching for it is the natural mistake when a new path hits the vote lock and the
# author decides the lock is being unhelpful. So the count is pinned, and the
# exemption has to be argued rather than copied.

STAKABLE_CALLS_N = 1  # stake.gno:Stake

# ARM 7 — every coin movement OUT of a user's balance is immediately preceded by a
# gate.
#
# This is the structural form of a thing that was being checked one path at a time.
# The vote lock and the stake lock both live in mustSpendable, so a new path that
# moves a holder's coin without calling it bypasses BOTH — silently, because the
# transfer succeeds and no arithmetic goes wrong. It is the natural shape of the
# mistake: a feature that needs to take a bond writes the Transfer and forgets the
# line above it.
#
# Audited by hand first, which is how the pairing turned out to be exact: seven
# user-sourced movements (the claim deposit, the answer bond, the dispute bond, the
# flag bond, the election nomination bond, and the two transfer paths), each with its
# gate on the line before. Movements sourced from c.escrow are exempt and must be:
# the escrow is not a voter, holds no lock, and its outflows are refunds and burns
# that the lanes owning them dispose of.
#
# Two pins, because either alone is weak. The COUNT fails closed on a new movement
# even if somebody gates it in an unusual way, and the ADJACENCY catches the ordinary
# omission. Together they mean a new outflow has to be looked at.
# Burn is in here, and leaving it out was this arm's own blind spot for one commit.
# lock.gno's spendable() clamp carries the comment "only reachable if a burn ever
# took coins out from under a lock. It does not today (nothing burns a user's
# balance)" — an anticipated hazard with nothing enforcing its non-occurrence, which
# is the exact shape this whole guard exists for. All eleven Burn sites are escrow-
# sourced today so the pinned count is unchanged; what changes is that a user-sourced
# burn can no longer arrive unnoticed. It would be worse than an ungated transfer:
# a transfer moves locked coin, a burn destroys it.
# ANY Court receiver, not just `c`. Five names are already used with .coin. in this
# tree — c (507 uses), mc (16), c2 (5), m (2), c3 (1) — because the meta court and the
# multi-court paths hold their own Court values. None of them moves coin TODAY, so the
# pinned count is unchanged; but `mc.coin.Transfer(who, ...)` was invisible to a
# pattern that hardcoded `c.`, and mc is not hypothetical, it is sixteen lines away
# doing Mint. Same class of blind spot as leaving Burn out: the regex assumed a
# spelling the file already contradicts elsewhere.
# ARM 8 — a vote-lock row can only ever be created by its own owner.
#
# The whole cost argument for the lock rests on this. voteLockedOf walks one address's
# rows on every mustSpendable path, at a measured 110,245 gas per dead row, so an
# address's row count is a tax on its own transfers. That is acceptable only because
# the rows are SELF-INFLICTED: all three lockVote sites pass cur.Previous().Address(),
# so nobody can grow another holder's row count. A single `lockVote(c, victim, ...)`
# would convert a self-imposed cost into a griefing weapon, and it would read as
# perfectly ordinary code — locking someone's vote is what this function is for.
#
# Three pins, because the address can go wrong in three places. The ARGUMENT must be
# `who`; every BINDING of `who` in a file that locks must come from
# cur.Previous().Address(); and any helper taking `who address` (approve does) must be
# called with cur.Previous().Address() — or with `who` itself, which is the same
# address one frame down and is how votelock.gno's own helpers legitimately pass it
# along — at every site, since the parameter is where a caller-supplied address would
# enter. Passing `who` is safe by induction: the binding pin above forces every `who`
# in a locking file to come from the caller in the first place. The COUNT is pinned too: a fourth lane that
# locks votes has to be argued, exactly as arm 6 pins mustStakable.

# answer to "how much can I spend" and is not. That trap has now been walked into three
# times: once in its own doc, once in AllowanceCC ("the amount actually movable is
# min(AllowanceCC, SpendableOf)" — over-promises by a whole vote commitment), and once
# in ccwrap's WrapRoom ("SpendableOf minus their own vote commitment" — which
# double-counts the overlap and understates the room, since the locks combine with MAX
# not SUM because staked coin still votes). Two errors in OPPOSITE directions from one
# missing instrument, which is what DisposableOf now is.
#
# The pattern is deliberately narrow: SpendableOf on a comment line that also carries a
# formula shape — `min(` or ` minus `. Both real instances match; the passages that
# correctly explain SpendableOf ("what an address may still STAKE", "quoting only
# SpendableOf over-promises") carry no formula and must not be flagged. Prose about the
# figure is fine. Arithmetic with it is what goes wrong.

# ARM 10 — "a quality question is open" has exactly ONE definition.
#
# The disjunction cs.flagOpen || cs.disputeOpen || cs.counterOpen was written three
# times: the vote lock's release predicate and both weight readers. That is arm 4's
# hazard one level down — a quote that can drift from the charge — and the drift is not
# symmetric. A fourth way to open a quality question that reached the readers but not the
# lock UNDER-locks, freeing coin whose vote can still be counted; one that reached the
# lock but not the readers quotes zero to a holder who can vote right now. Neither copy
# is the safe one to forget, so there is one, qualityQuestionOpen, and this counts it.
#
# TWO lines legitimately hold such a disjunction, and the second is why this arm pins a
# SHAPE rather than a filename. openrewards.gno asks its own question —
# `cs.flagOpen || cs.counterOpen || cs.pendingSlash > 0` — which deliberately excludes
# disputeOpen and adds a pending slash. It is not a copy of ours and must not be
# "simplified" into one. So: exactly two such lines, the definition carries all three
# flags, and the other carries pendingSlash, which is what makes it a different question
# rather than a partial copy of this one. A third line fails closed.

# ARM 11 — the release rule says the same thing in the code and in the handoff spec.
#
# This one polices PROSE, and it earned its place the hard way: the quality release rule
# has gone stale in three documents. All three said a quality vote releases "when its
# tally is superseded", which was the FIRST version of the predicate and was wrong,
# because a tally is superseded only by a new round and nothing makes a round open. The
# worst instance was in VOTEFLOOR.md's web-client section — text written so another
# session could implement the surface "without re-deriving any of it", which would have
# become a UI telling holders the wrong thing about their own coin.
#
# So one clause is canonical and lives in both places: votelock.gno's summary of the
# predicate, and the spec's quote of it. Neither can be edited alone. This does not pin
# the CODE — arms 8 and 10 and the corpus do that — it pins that the sentence humans
# read has not drifted from the sentence the author of the predicate wrote.
#
# Whitespace-normalised, because the code carries it as an aligned comment and the
# document as prose, and an alignment change is not news.
RULE_CLAUSE = "some question is open now OR these weights carry forward"
# EXACT counts, per file. Presence alone was tried first and is too coarse: VOTEFLOOR.md
# states the rule twice — once as the quote implementers work from, once in the record of
# the correction — so a presence check passes when the SPEC's copy is rewritten and the
# historical one is left, which is precisely the failure being guarded. Counted both

# THE OTHER ARMS WERE AUDITED FOR THE SAME BLIND SPOT AND ARE CLEAN. Three arms have

# receiver). The obvious next move is to widen everything for symmetry, and that is
# wrong: a pattern loosened for a spelling that does not exist buys nothing and costs
# precision. So the remaining hardcoded spellings were checked against the tree, not
# against imagination:
#
#   arm 3   `^func \(g \*Governor\)`     60 of 60 Governor methods use `g`.
#   arm 6   `mustStakable\(c, `           only `c` is ever passed to either helper.
#   arm 5   `^\s*cs\.`                    `acs` and `dcs` exist but ONLY in _test
#                                          files, which this guard does not scan.

#                                          the two arms are documented as a pair.

# bond, and it is gated by mustSpendable on the line above the move. The count is
# the arm's whole content — a new outflow that forgot its gate would land here as
# a 9th, which is what this number is for.
#
# 8 -> 9: posting.gno's BuyCommentPass, and it is a different KIND from the eight
# before it. Every one of those moves a holder's coin INTO the escrow, where the
# realm can later burn or return it; this one burns from the holder's balance
# directly and nothing is ever held. That is deliberate — an escrowed pass would
# put a refund decision in a moderator's hands and would park CC where votableAt
# nets it out of the quorum bar — but it means the sentence lock.gno's spendable()
# carried for this whole realm's life, "nothing burns a user's balance", is now
# false and was corrected in the same commit. Gated by mustSpendable on the line
# above the burn, like the rest.

# ARM 13 — every mint is accounted, and there are exactly three of them.
#
# Arm 7 censuses coin leaving a holder's balance. Nothing censused coin ARRIVING, and
# the two are not symmetric in consequence: an ungated outflow moves committed coin,
# while an unaccounted mint breaks the DILUTION CEILING. emission.gno says so in one
# line — "mintEmission is the ONLY emission mint: bounds-checked against the court's
# own ledger and counted into emittedTotal (which feeds d_eff)" — and nothing enforced
# it. A fourth mint site that skipped emittedTotal would emit real coin that the
# ceiling could not see, silently, because no arithmetic goes wrong and the buyer's
# balance is correct.
#
# THREE SITES, audited by hand rather than assumed, and every one of them pairs its
# mint with the accounting that makes it legitimate:
#
#   buy.gno         c.minted += delta      then c.coin.Mint  — the curve
#   meta.gno        mc.minted += delta     then mc.coin.Mint — the franchise claim,
#                                                              sharing meta's own
#                                                              monotone curve position
#   emission.gno    c.coin.Mint            then c.emittedTotal = mustAdd(...)
#
# So the accounting sits ABOVE the mint on the curve paths and BELOW it in
# mintEmission, which is why the window is +/-2 lines rather than "the lines above"
# like arm 7's gate.
#
# The RECV spelling matters here more than anywhere: meta's mint is on `mc`, not `c`.
# A pattern hardcoding `c.coin.Mint` would have counted two of three and called the
# census clean — the exact blind spot arm 7 records having been widened for.

# ARM 14 — every PURGE verb carries both of its gates.
#
# Purge is the LEGAL removal: it erases text behind a statutory category code and takes
# a global-DAO threshold to fire. Four verbs do it — PurgeClaim, PurgeCourt,
# PurgeModLogRow, PurgeFolder — and each opens with the same two gates, the authority
# check and mustCategoryCode.
#
# The category-code check is now single-sited, so its CONDITION cannot drift. What no
# single site fixes is a FIFTH verb that forgets to call it, or forgets the authority
# gate: that is a new function, and a corpus row cannot be written for code nobody has
# written yet. Hence a census.
#
# THE AUTHORITY GATE IS DELIBERATELY NOT EXTRACTED, and this arm is what makes leaving
# it alone defensible. Four identical copies of `ensureGlobalDAO()` plus a members.Has
# check is exactly the duplication the category code just lost — but hiding
# ensureGlobalDAO behind a helper would take it out of check-read-purity's sight, which
# greps function BODIES for allocator calls, so an exported read reaching the helper
# would no longer be flagged. Pinning that every purge verb still spells the gate out
# keeps both guards working on the same text.

#                    the reason the others do: a claim's evidence is the surface
#                    a statutory removal is most likely to be ABOUT, so it needs
#                    the same threshold and the same category code as the text.
#                    It removes the court's pointer, not the bytes; the archive

# Arm 16: the purged-court gate, and WHICH side of the line each reader is on.
#
# courtIsPurged used to carry a comment naming its two readers. By the time
# anyone looked there were five, so the enumeration was guarding nothing. The
# rule it stood for is a predicate: read the gate on a path that BEGINS a
# commitment, never on one that settles or releases a commitment already made.
# A gate on a release path is how a purged court strands an answered claim's
# stakers — the exact failure MODERATION.md §2 forbids.

#
# CLAIM_BOARDS.md S1: "no money path reads board, standing, level, pass, vote or
# freeze state". The coupling is one-way and one-way only — money paths WRITE to
# the standing ledger through four named credit hooks, and read nothing back. That
# is what keeps a settlement independent of a claim's comment section: if a payout
# could read a level or a vote, a flooded board would move money, and S5's "a
# claim settles identically to the same claim with no bits set" would be false.
#
# It held on inspection and nothing enforced it, which for a one-way coupling is
# the whole risk: the first read looks harmless at the call site and is invisible

#
# stakeindex.gno states the first as a fact about the whole realm: "Positions are
# never removed — there is no stakers.Remove anywhere in this realm", and
# dispute.gno repeats it while reasoning about a stake's fate. The numbering
# stakeindex hands out depends on it: a removed position would renumber the rows
# after it. Measured 0 code sites — and worth noting the naive grep finds THREE
# matches, all of them the comments that state the claim, so the pattern requires
# a receiver to avoid counting the promise as its own violation.
#
# AND IT MUST NOT BE ANCHORED TO THE START OF THE STATEMENT, which is how it was
# first written — `^\s*\w+\.stakers\.Remove\(`. Its own control arm plants
# `if pv := cs.stakers.Remove(...)`, the shape a removal would actually be written
# in, and the anchored pattern could not see it: selftest reported the arm SILENT.
# The receiver requirement is kept, because the reason above still holds; what
# changed is skipping COMMENT LINES rather than requiring the call to begin the
# line, which is the shape LOCKED_READ below already used in this same commit.
#
# The lesson generalises past this line, so COIN_OUT and MINT were re-measured the
# same way: both were anchored too, and on the shipped tree the counts are
# identical either way (36 and 3), so nothing was being missed — it was latent.
# A control arm that plants in the very shape its pattern assumes cannot reveal

# off the code" arms cannot help either: narrowing a pattern whose expected count
