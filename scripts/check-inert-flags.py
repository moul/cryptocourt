"""A flag that is read but never set is an answer that can never change.

    python3 scripts/check-inert-flags.py

THE FAILURE, and it is live on gnoland-1 right now. testclock.gno declares
`tcEverArmed bool` and TestClockFabricated() returns it. On mainnet nothing
assigns it, so that function answers false forever -- including after the clock
has been armed and time fabricated. The getter is byte-identical to the working
one, which is exactly why nobody caught it: the code that reads the flag looks
correct, and the flag it reads is dead.

It is not a hypothetical elsewhere either. kourt-1 answers TRUE to the same
question today, because the copy deployed there does assign it. Same function,
same name, opposite truthfulness, decided by a single line six hundred lines
away from the getter.

WHAT THIS CANNOT TELL YOU. A flag with no writer is unambiguous; a flag with a
writer that is merely unreachable is not, and this does not attempt it. Dead
simple, and therefore trustworthy about the one thing it claims.

TESTS DO NOT COUNT AS WRITERS. A flag set only by a test is inert in the realm
that ships, which is the realm that matters. Counting them would make the guard
agree with the code exactly when the code is wrong.
