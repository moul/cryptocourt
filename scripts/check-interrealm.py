"""A secondary `realm` parameter is not the caller until you prove it is.

    python3 scripts/check-interrealm.py

THE RULE, and it is not the one Solidity teaches. A crossing function's FIRST
`cur realm` parameter is runtime-current by construction -- the VM sets it, the
caller cannot forge it, and `cur.Previous()` inside it really is the caller. A
realm value in ANY OTHER position is just an argument. Whoever called you chose
it. Asking such a value who the caller was and believing the answer is how a
realm ends up executing somebody else's authority, and it does not look wrong on
the page: `rlm.Previous().Address()` reads identically whether `rlm` is the
first parameter or the fourth.

`rlm.IsCurrent()` is the proof. It returns true only when that realm value
matches the topmost live crossing frame, so a value handed in by a caller fails
it. Check first, then trust.

WHY THIS GUARD EXISTS WHILE THE TREE IS CLEAN. It is clean by ABSENCE: eleven
`Do(_ int, rlm realm, payload string)` implementations carry a secondary realm
parameter and not one of them touches it -- authority comes from the proposal
having passed, not from `rlm`. That is a safe design nobody wrote down, and the
next person to need the caller's address inside a `Do` will reach for `rlm`
because it is right there in the signature. This guard is the note that says
check it first.

ALSO FLAGGED: `unsafe.PreviousRealm()` in a function that has a `cur realm`
parameter. It is a STACK-WALKER -- it answers about the last realm boundary,
not about your caller -- and reaching for it when `cur` is in scope means
bypassing the frame verification `cur` gives you for free. Today this tree calls
only `unsafe.OriginCaller` and `unsafe.OriginSend`, both legitimate.
