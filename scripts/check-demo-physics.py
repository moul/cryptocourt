"""Hold the demo dataset to the realm's own arithmetic.

The demo exists so every screen renders offline. That is only worth having if
what it renders is a state the chain could actually be in — otherwise the
sample teaches the reader something false, and no test notices, because the
demo is data and data has no tests.

It went wrong exactly that way. Every conviction value in `DEMO` was between
6x and 29x ABOVE the realm's maximum for its own stated stake and lifetime --
at the unreachable ceiling; against the launch floor the factors ran to 74x.
Three invariants a human had written down in comments (the burn curve, the
senior-queue sum, the series/pool agreement) all held; the one nobody wrote
down was the one that broke. So they ALL get written down here, as code —
including the three that did hold, because "it holds today" is not a property,
it is an observation. Encoding them immediately found a fourth violation: the
annex court's burn was a round 18,000,000,000 where its own curve says
17,999,760,001, under a comment asserting the value is exact.

The constants are READ FROM THE REALM, never copied. If someone retunes
`r0WeeklyBps` or `periodBlocks`, this check retunes with them; a check that
hardcodes the number it is checking only pins the moment it was written.

    claimant bought. Counting it again here would double it.
