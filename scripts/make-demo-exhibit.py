"""Build the one exhibit the OFFLINE demo shows, as an inline data: URI.

    scripts/make-demo-exhibit.py            # print the first sheet's line
    scripts/make-demo-exhibit.py --claim3   # the whole media block for bedford/3
    scripts/make-demo-exhibit.py --covers   # the folder faces
    scripts/make-demo-exhibit.py --check    # verify the page still carries them

WHY THE DEMO NEEDS ITS OWN BYTES. web/README.md promises one self-contained file
that runs from file:// and makes no network calls in demo mode. A real exhibit
resolves to https://<site>/m/<sha256> — the archive — so putting a real one in
the sample would break exactly that promise, and off a network it would draw a
broken-image icon instead of evidence. Bytes carried in the page are the only
kind an offline demo can honestly show.

WHY IT IS ABSTRACT. It stands in for a scan of an inspection report. It does NOT
render one: a plausible-looking government document with legible findings is a
fabricated record, and this project is a court. Grey bars are what a page of
text looks like at thumbnail size anyway, which is the size that matters on a
map node — so the honest version is also the one that reads correctly.

The generator is committed rather than just its output so the blob in
web/index.html has provenance: you can see what the bytes are without decoding
them, and --check proves the page still carries what this file describes.
