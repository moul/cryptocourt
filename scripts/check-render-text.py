"""User text reaches the page through a named gate, and only through it.

AGENTS.md states the rule in prose: "Render(path string) receives
attacker-controlled input. Never write path segments, user-supplied keys, or
free-form string values directly into markdown output." modrender.gno states it
twice more, about its own two gates:

  claimTitleFor  "is THE single place a claim's title becomes display text"
  claimBodyVisible  "EVERY CALLER MUST SANITISE FOR ITS OWN OUTPUT CONTEXT, and
                     they do not agree on which helper"

Three statements of one policy, and nothing enforced any of them. This does.

WHY IT IS WORTH A GUARD rather than a comment, given both policies hold today
(measured: `.title`'s only display read is the sanitised one in claimTitleFor,
and both callers of claimBodyVisible sanitise — with DIFFERENT helpers, Block and
Blockquote, exactly as its comment predicts). The consequence of a violation is
not a wrong number, it is HTML on a page people stake money on. modrender.gno's
own note spells it out: sanitize.Block escapes CommonMark §4.6 block types 1-5
but NOT types 6 and 7, so a `<form>` or a `<table>` in a claim body is only
CONTAINED by a trailing blank line, and gnoweb runs no HTML sanitiser after the
realm. A new render surface that forgot to sanitise would be invisible to every
existing check: the corpus spot-checks one unsanitised symbol and nothing else.

A CENSUS, not a pattern, and for the same reason check-spend-paths is one: the
sanctioned readers are few and named, so the check that catches a NEW one is
"the set changed", which no regex over call sites can say. Adding a reader means
adding it here with a reason — which is the point.

FAILS CLOSED on a reader it does not recognise and on a census entry that has
gone missing, because the two failures need opposite fixes: an unknown reader is
a possible injection, a vanished entry is a gate that was deleted or renamed.

# `title` the same way") and pins the consequence on every page. What is new here is
# only the CONSUMER, at the end of this note. CourtName returns `mustCourt(slug).name` unsanitised and that is sanctioned
# — sanitize/v0's rule is "sanitise once, at the point of output", and its own doc
# says "a court's parameters are not secret". But mustCourtName validates LENGTH
# ONLY: no alphabet, and no newline check, where mustCourtDesc refuses newlines with
# a stated reason that applies to the name just as well ("it renders inline beside a
# court name in list rows, where a newline forges a row"). kourtv2's own render is
# safe because InlineText folds. The consumer that is NOT is realm/r/ccwrap, which
# builds a GRC20 token name as "Wrapped " + CourtName(slug) — raw user text crossing
# into another realm's display field. Left alone deliberately: tightening
# mustCourtName now would refuse names live courts may already hold, which is a

# THE SCOPE ABOVE IS kourtv2 ONLY, AND THAT IS WHERE THE HOLE WAS. CourtName is
# sanctioned to return raw text on the rule that "consumers sanitise at their own
# output" — and nothing checked that any consumer did. The note above even named
# the consumer, r/ccwrap, and left it: the reasoning was that tightening
# mustCourtName would refuse names live courts may already hold. That is still
# right, and it is not a reason for the OUTPUT to stay unsanitised.
#
# What was actually there: mustCourtName validates length only, 1..100 characters,
# where mustCourtDesc beside it walks the string and refuses newlines. ccwrap's
# Enable built the wrapped token's name as `"Wrapped " + kourtv2.CourtName(slug)`
# and its Render wrote that name into an H1 with `ufmt.Sprintf("# %s\n\n"...)`.
# So any address that could call StartCourt could put headings, list rows and raw
# HTML on ccwrap's page, and gnoweb runs no sanitiser after a realm.
