# Seed a REMOTE chain with a scenario: keys, genesis, then the scenario's own
# transactions. scripts/seed-node.sh does this against a gnodev it starts itself;
# this does it against a chain deploy/chain.sh puts on a server.
#
# WHY IT IS ONE SCRIPT AND NOT A RUNBOOK. Three facts have to line up, and getting
# any of them wrong fails late and confusingly:
#
#   1. THE SCENARIO'S ACTORS MUST BE FUNDED AT GENESIS. Balances come from nothing
#      only there; after the first block the routes are the faucet's 100-GNOT drip
#      or a transfer from somebody who already holds coin. Seventeen random keys
#      are made per run, so their addresses cannot be written into a runbook.
#
#   2. THE SCENARIO'S `deployer` MUST BE THE REALM'S DEPLOYER. testclock.gno
#      captures `tcDeployer = unsafe.OriginCaller()` at package init and gates
#      every clock write on it, and the scenario signs EnableTestClockAt and every
#      AdvanceTestClock as `deployer`. So the key that signs the genesis packages
#      and the key the scenario drives the clock with have to be the same one —
#      which is why chain.sh is handed this keyring as DEPLOYER_HOME rather than
#      making its own.
#
#   3. ONE PASSWORD. chain.sh's genesis signing uses `kourt-genesis`, hardcoded,
#      so every key here is created with it and the scenario is run with
#      PASS=kourt-genesis. A keyring cannot hold two.
#
# DESTRUCTIVE. This resets the chain: every balance, court, claim and position on
# it is discarded. The scenario also ARMS THE TEST CLOCK, so every date on the
# seeded chain is fabricated — and EnableTestClock refuses on a realm with any
# history, which is the deeper reason a re-seed cannot be incremental.

# TWO WAYS TO SEED, and the fast one is the default — the same split
# scripts/seed-node.sh has run locally for a while, brought over here.
#
#   genesis  every transaction goes into the genesis file, applied at InitChain
#   plan     every transaction is a `gnokey maketx -broadcast`, one at a time
#
# MEASURED against kourt.xyz on covid_demo: 656 transactions, ~0.36s each, which
# is very nearly the whole ten-minute run. Almost none of it is the chain — the
# node answers a query in ~30ms and commits one to two blocks a second — it is
# the LOCAL keyring decrypt and signature, once per transaction. The genesis path
# pays none of it: nothing is signed and no gnokey is spawned, because a genesis
# transaction signs over (chainID, 0, 0) and the node skips verifying it.
#
# THE PLAN PATH STAYS, and not for sentiment: it checks every transaction as it
# lands and prints the realm's own panic when one fails. Genesis application is
# bulk and does not stop on a failure, so reach for SEED_MODE=plan when a
# scenario is being debugged rather than merely served.
SEED_MODE="${SEED_MODE:-genesis}"

# name, address AND pubkey, for BOTH modes: --emit txs needs the key for its
# signature slot (std.Tx.ValidateBasic refuses an empty signatures array
# outright, so each transaction carries its caller's pubkey with empty signature
# bytes — the shape gno.land's own genesis_txs.jsonl uses), and --emit checks
# needs the addresses to assert against. Built here, above the split, because
# the assertions run either way.

Seeded $CHAINID at $REMOTE from $SCN.

  deployer $DEP
           owns the realm and is the only address that may drive the test clock.
           It lives in $KEYDIR — back that up; losing it is unrecoverable.

  Conformance-check the overlay's live reads against this chain:

      python3 scripts/check-live-reads.py --remote $REMOTE --court <slug>

  This is the only check that walks the reads the page actually issues against
  a real node, and the class of defect it finds is one the demo dataset cannot
  surface: the sample's courts are mature and its numbers were chosen by hand,
  while a freshly seeded chain is young, poor and sparse. It is deliberately
  not in \`make check\`, which must not require a running chain, so the seed is
  the place that points at it — as seed-node.sh already does for a local node.

  NAME THE COURT. The flag defaults to "bedford", which is the court smoke.py
  seeds, and this path defaults to $SCN instead. Pointing it at a court the
  chain does not carry reports EVERY read as "no such court" — a wall of
  failures that looks like a broken realm rather than a wrong argument.
