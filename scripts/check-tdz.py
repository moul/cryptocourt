"""A top-level const must not be built from one declared below it.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. Twice in one week:

    const REF_SET_MARKS = [SET_MARK, SHUT_MARK];   // SET_MARK is 10k lines below
    const DEMO = { ..., franchise:{ [DEMO_ME]: 41_637_004 }, ... };   // 30 below

`const` hoists into the temporal dead zone but is not initialised until its own
line runs, so an initialiser that runs AT LOAD and names a later const throws
"Cannot access 'X' before initialization" — and takes the whole script with it.

WHAT MAKES IT WORTH A GUARD RATHER THAN CARE. Both were invisible to every source
harness, and for the same reason: a harness evaluates a SLICE of this file and
sets the names it needs as globals first, so the ordering the browser enforces is
exactly the thing a harness cannot see. Both reached a deployed page. The first
was found by a browser check that happened to load the route; the second by
loading the page by hand. Nothing in `make check` would ever have said a word.

WHAT IS FLAGGED, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT. Only initialisers that EVALUATE AT
LOAD. A reference from inside a function or arrow body is fine — by the time
anything calls it, every top-level const has run:

    const f = () => SET_MARK;        // fine, and the file is full of these
    const A = [SET_MARK];            // flagged
    const B = { k: [DEMO_ME] };      // flagged

So function and arrow bodies are cut out of the initialiser before it is read.
That is the whole of the cleverness here, and it is why this can run over a
twenty-thousand-line file without drowning the reader in noise.
