// WHAT PROTECTS A WRITE, AND THE DEPLOYMENT WHERE IT USED TO PROTECT NOTHING.
//
// Two checks guard a POST: Content-Type must be application/json, and Sec-Fetch-Site must not say
// cross-site. The reasoning behind them is sound for the SAFELISTED shapes — a form cannot produce
// application/json, and a no-cors fetch cannot set it either, so neither can reach this endpoint
// without a preflight.
//
// A preflighted fetch can. Measured against the real server with Origin https://evil.example:
//
//	OPTIONS preflight             204, Access-Control-Allow-Origin *, POST among the methods
//	POST without Sec-Fetch-Site   200, and the message was in the room
//	POST with    Sec-Fetch-Site   403
//
// Sec-Fetch-* is only sent to potentially-trustworthy origins, so on plain HTTP to anything but
// localhost it never arrives and "absent is allowed" meant a hostile page could make its visitors
// post — which is the attack the comment above csrfOK opens by describing. Nothing here uses
// cookies, so the attack needs no credentials: the identity IS the visitor's address.
//
// Requiring the header on those deployments is not available — no browser sends it, so every
// legitimate post would go too. Origin and Host are both browser-set and unforgeable by script,
// so the absent case compares those instead. Only the absent case, which is why the whole suite
// stayed green: when the header arrives it keeps deciding.
