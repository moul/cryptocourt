// Does the scanner stall chat?
//
// CHAT.md §1 chooses ONE database file for two processes, over the alternative of
// splitting them so isolation is enforced by file permissions. The argument for one
// file was that SQLite in WAL mode allows many readers alongside one writer, that
// reads and writes get separate handles, and that the scanner never holds a
// transaction across an inference. All three are claims about runtime behaviour, and
// a source-level check cannot see any of them — so they are measured here.
//
// What is NOT claimed: that a POST is instant while another writer holds the lock.
// SQLite has one writer, so it cannot be. What must hold is that a held write
// transaction does not break chat — reads stay fast, and a write waits and then
// succeeds rather than failing.
