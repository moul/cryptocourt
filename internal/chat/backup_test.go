// THE BACKUP PROCEDURE §9 RECOMMENDS, PINNED — because a wrong backup is silent until a
// restore, which is the worst moment to discover anything.
//
// §9 records the measurement that motivates it: on a server holding three messages, `chat.db`
// was 4,096 bytes of header while `chat.db-wal` held the schema AND every row, so `cp chat.db`
// produced a file that opens cleanly and answers `no such table: messages`. Nothing tested
// either half of that — not the trap, and not the `VACUUM INTO` the document tells an operator
// to use instead. The consequence of the second going quietly wrong is worse than the first:
// an operator who follows the advice would believe they had backups.
//
// The two arms are paired on purpose. A test that only asserted "VACUUM INTO copies the rows"
// would also pass if the main file were self-sufficient, in which case it would be measuring
// nothing about the WAL at all. The naive copy failing is what makes the good copy meaningful.
