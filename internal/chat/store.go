// must stop driving verdicts. Withdrawn content is in the same position and the reasoning

// A court that is still being scanned and still filling a moderator's queue has not been
// withdrawn in any sense an operator would recognise; it has only been hidden from readers.
//
// The counter-argument, which is real: a scam is a scam, and its author should be stopped
// elsewhere too. That is what the live courts are for — they are where the author is still
// able to do harm, and where the scanner is still looking. Freezing is a deliberate act taken

//
// It is a constant for the reason the note below gives: this exact predicate was
// written out at both places that consult a freeze — Post, inside its write
// transaction, and IsFrozen, on the read handle so the serving path pays nothing

//	                  are hidden-but-uncited and would otherwise look unactioned.
//	verdict flagged   clean and unknown are not accusations; '' was never scanned.
//	no citing row     an infraction naming this message means a consequence already followed.

// time precisely so deleting the message cannot destroy what an appeal reads, and the
// review queue has since added a constraint that did not exist when this was deferred.
//
// WHAT IT WILL NOT DELETE, whatever the cutoff says:
//
//   - UNSCANNED messages. The scanner has not looked yet, and deleting one is not
//     retention policy, it is silently skipping moderation. This covers the outage case:
//     if the model has been unreachable for a month, a 30-day prune must not quietly
//     erase the backlog instead of classifying it.
//   - Messages AWAITING REVIEW — flagged, no consequence citing them, not dismissed.
//     §7's carve-out defers exactly these to a person; deleting them empties that
//     person's queue without anyone deciding anything.
//   - Messages cited by a consequence still IN FORCE. The appeal text survives in
//     `evidence`, so the record is safe either way, but `Revoke` restores a punished
//     author's hidden messages, and it cannot restore rows that are gone. Once the
