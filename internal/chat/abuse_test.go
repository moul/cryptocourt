// The HTTP surface under deliberate abuse.
//
// Everything else about this service is reached through here, and this is the only part
// of it exposed to the open internet. The existing server tests cover the decisions —
// CSRF, the chain allowlist, the throttle, the field limits. What they do not cover is
// malformed input: path shapes, type confusion in the JSON, bodies that are too big,
// and the content-type variants a real client actually sends.
//
// Every refusal here is paired with the ordinary request it must NOT refuse, because a
// handler that 400s everything passes a table of refusals and serves nobody. Two of the
// pairs matter more than the rest: `application/json; charset=utf-8` is what a great
// many HTTP clients send and refusing it would be a self-inflicted outage, and a
// too-large body must be REFUSED rather than truncated into a shorter message that then
// looks legitimate.

// postOK advances past the per-address interval and asserts the post lands.
//
// Needed because every request in this file comes from httptest's single default address
// against a frozen clock, so the SECOND accepted post in any fixture is a 429. The first
// version of these tests read as five content-type failures that were really one throttle
// doing its job — the throttle is not what is under test here, so it is stepped over
