	// ahead and sends the write; the Content-Type requirement stops the SAFELISTED shapes (a form

	   re-read is what makes a moderator's hide vanish from a screen already showing
	   it, which an append-by-id client would never notice.
	   So the long poll asks its question with `seen`, which changes nothing about
	   the reply: it is the highest id the caller has already drawn, and the only
	   thing this handler does with it is decide whether to answer now or wait. The
	   first version of this reused `since` and the reply came back EMPTY — one
	   parameter cannot be both a filter and a watermark, and the test that caught it
	   compares the held payload against the unheld one for exactly that reason.
	   WAIT IS OPT-IN AND CAPPED. Without it this behaves exactly as it did; with it
	   the request holds until the court changes, the cap expires, or the client goes
	   away. An older client sends nothing and gets the old behaviour; an older
