// /delete — TAKE BACK THE MESSAGE YOU JUST SENT.
//
// The rule is "the newest VISIBLE row in the room, if it is yours and said
// within WithdrawWindow", and each arm below is one clause of that.
//
// IT USED TO READ THE NEWEST ROW OF ANY KIND, which made a tombstone block the
// message beneath it: after taking back one line you could never take back the
// one before. Reported three times; the third time with the rows in hand.
//
// WHAT THAT OLD READING WAS REALLY PROTECTING IS STILL PROTECTED, by two bounds
// rather than by accident. The newest visible row must be YOURS, so somebody
// else's line ends the run and this can never reach behind another person's
// message to leave their reply answering nothing; and the window means "take
// back what I just said" cannot become "edit the record". The griefing case —
// one message per command, all the way back through a transcript — is
// impossible in both directions.
