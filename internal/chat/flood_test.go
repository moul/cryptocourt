// Can one address bury the person the carve-out depends on?
//
// §7 defers reporting-shaped messages to a human because gemma3:4b cannot tell reporting
// a scam from sending one. That deferral is the design's answer to its own weakest point,
// and it has a cost nobody had measured: the queue is a shared, finite resource called
// somebody's attention, and filling it is cheaper than evading the classifier.
//
// The attack needs no evasion at all. Reporting-shaped text is what gets carved out, so
// the attacker writes exactly that, varies a number so the skeleton dedup does not fire,
// and stays inside the throttle. Measured against the flat queue: 70 accepted, the single
// genuine report at position 71 of 71, and all twenty of the first rows an operator reads
// belonging to the attacker.
//
// What follows pins the flat queue's weakness AND the grouped view that answers it, in one
// fixture, because the second is only meaningful beside the first.

// flood posts n reporting-shaped messages from one address, respecting the throttle.
//
// Returns what actually landed rather than what was attempted, and the LAST body that
// landed — which is not the (accepted-1)th attempt, because the throttle's refusals are
// scattered through the loop. Assuming otherwise cost one wrong assertion: 70 of 200 got
// through and the final accepted message was attempt 183, not attempt 69.
