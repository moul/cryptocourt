// TWO JOBS, TWO FUNCTIONS. The first draft of this file did both at once and did
// both badly — measured, not supposed: it turned "👨‍👩‍👧" into three separate
// people, "❤️" into "❤", the Persian "می‌روم" into the wrong word, and it
// REFUSED "Bitcoin-биржа" and "alice@почта.рф" as homoglyph attacks — while
// Cherokee "ᏚᏟᎪᎷ" (which reads as SCAM) and combining-mark "s͡c͡a͡m" passed
// untouched. Too aggressive on real text and too permissive on the actual evasion
// class, because one string cannot be both faithfully displayable and
// aggressively comparable.
//
//	Sanitize — makes text safe to STORE and DISPLAY, preserving meaning. This is
//	           what a reader sees and what the scanner is shown. Conservative: it
//	           removes only what cannot be displayed honestly.
//	Skeleton — makes text COMPARABLE. Folds confusables, drops everything
//	           decorative. Never displayed, never stored as a body. Evasion
//	           resistance lives here: duplicate detection and the scanner's
//	           "what does this actually say" signal.
//
// Evasion resistance had to move out of Sanitize because mutating displayed text
// to fight homoglyphs corrupts the text of everyone whose alphabet is not English.

// Limits, in RUNES rather than bytes. A byte limit is a length limit for English
// and a censor for everything else: "мошенничество" is 26 bytes.
// DefaultMoniker is who you are when you have not said who you are. A blank name
// used to be a 400 — "pick a name first" — which asked a reader for a decision
// before they could say anything, on a panel whose own warning is that names here
// are unverified and prove nothing. So the blank has an answer instead of a
// refusal, and everyone who never chose shares it.
//
// SUBSTITUTED BEFORE SanitizeMoniker, not inside it: text that a reader DID type
// and that sanitizes away to nothing is still refused, because that is a name they
// chose and cannot have. Only an empty field becomes this.
//
// web/chat.js declares the same word as CHATDEFAULTNAME and paneldrift_test pins
// the two together — a panel showing one default while the server stores another
// is the drift that test exists for.

	// and the message a Hebrew speaker got was that their message "stacks too
	// many marks on one character". Fully-voweled Arabic (`اللَّٰهُمَّ`) and
	// Hebrew niqqud with cantillation both land exactly ON 3, so the cap had no
	// headroom at all for the scripts that need it most:
	//
	//	consonant + vowel                      1   accepted

	// 14-mark monster all reduce to exactly "scam", and "send me your s̈ëëd̈
	// p̈ḧräs̈ë" reduces to "sendmeyourseedphrase", which the prefilter matches on

	// measured rather than argued: see TestSkeletonFoldsAnyMarkStackToThePlainWord.
	//
	// What remains is the LAYOUT argument, which is real but only at volume: a
	// stack sits above its character until roughly a dozen marks and only then
	// smears up through the line above. So the cap goes above real text's ceiling

// Syriac format characters ... part of well-formed text in those scripts". That

// format characters that precede digits and belong to the text. The list was that
// property as of an older Unicode, and it had since grown, so four members were
// falling through to the `remaining Cf` catch-all and being erased SILENTLY:
//
//	U+0890   ARABIC POUND MARK ABOVE
//	U+0891   ARABIC PIASTRE MARK ABOVE
//	U+110BD  KAITHI NUMBER SIGN

// the standard way to make mixed-direction text render correctly — which a court
// discussing "claim 7" in Arabic produces constantly. They are erased anyway,
// because the neutrals whose direction they resolve are, here, claim numbers and
// amounts, and a mark that can move a digit to the other side of a figure is worth
// more to an attacker than to a writer. The cost is real and bounded: no character
// of anybody's message is lost, and some mixed-direction sentences render with
// punctuation or a trailing number on the wrong side. That is a trade rather than
// an oversight, and it is the one place this file chooses against the writer.
