// A BAD BAN, FROM THE OPERATOR'S SIDE.
//
// Every other fixture here asks whether the guilty are caught. This one asks what happens to
// somebody who did nothing, because that is the failure with a person on the other end of it: a
// wrongly banned user cannot post to appeal, and the operator has to work out what was done, what
// it took down, and how to give it back — from the CLI, after the fact, with only an ip_hash.
//
// The walk is deliberately end-to-end rather than per-method. Each step below is a surface the
// operator actually reads (`status`, `list`, `why`, `unban`) and the bug this class of fixture
// exists to catch lives BETWEEN them: a reversal that clears the status but leaves the messages
// hidden, or restores the messages but leaves the address unable to speak, passes every
// single-method test and is still a person locked out.
