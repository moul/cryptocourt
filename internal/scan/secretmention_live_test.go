// END TO END, WITH THE REAL MODEL: saying the words must not be punished; asking must be.
//
// A bare mention of a seed phrase used to set a deterministic floor of scam — a 24-hour first
// offence with no model in the loop, earned by all eight of the ordinary sentences in
// prefilter_test.go. It is a note now, and the model decides. This is the walk that shows the
// two halves of that trade in one run.
//
// What is ASSERTED is structural: the lure earns a consequence, and each ordinary speaker is a
// BYSTANDER who must still be able to post afterwards. What is LOGGED is the model's judgement,
// following dilution_test.go — a test that fails because a 4B model said clean instead of scam
// about one sentence teaches nothing, and the numbers are what a future reader needs.
