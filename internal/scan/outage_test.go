// What does an operator see when the model goes away mid-run?
//
// This is not a hypothetical failure. §1 justifies two processes rather than one on
// exactly this: "a 7B model against an 8GB budget will OOM, and an OOM in the scanner must
// not take HTTP down." The design predicted the outage and got the isolation right — chat
// keeps serving. What nobody had checked is what the MODERATION side looks like afterwards.
//
// The machinery is sound in isolation. RecordFailure backs off and gives up after five
// attempts, marking the row ScanDone so a permanently malformed message cannot be retried
// forever, and Claim reclaims anything a dead daemon left claimed. Both are right.
//
// Composed, they have a consequence neither one shows: a message that exhausts its
// attempts is ScanDone with an EMPTY verdict. Health.Backlog counts ScanNew and ScanFailed
// only, so the row leaves the backlog; PendingReview requires a non-clean verdict, so it
// never reaches the review queue; and Run writes a heartbeat every cycle whether or not
// anything was classified. Every indicator goes green while nothing is being classified.
//
// clock is a settable now for the store; the scanner itself reads no clock.
