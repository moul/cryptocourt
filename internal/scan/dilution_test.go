// DILUTION: burying a lure in enough of your own harmless text that the model stops seeing
// it. It works, and then it does not, and the reason why is the interesting part.
//
// The attack is cheap to attempt. An author's prior context is capped at five messages
// (priorTx) and a body at 400 runes, so one address can stage roughly 2,000 runes of its own
// choosing ahead of a 400-rune message, for five posts and ten seconds of the per-address
// interval.
//
// IT WORKS WITH REPETITIVE FILLER. Measured against gemma3:4b:
//
//	bare lure, 66 runes                        scam  0.90
//	bare lure padded to 397 runes              scam  0.95
//	lure + 2,000 runes of prior (2,076 total)   scam  0.95
//	padded lure + same prior (2,407 total)      CLEAN 0.95
//
// NOT A CONTEXT-WINDOW PROBLEM, which was the first hypothesis and the wrong one: the same
// payload came back clean 0.95 at num_ctx 2048, 4096 AND 8192. Raising the window is not a
// fix; the model reads the text and dilutes.
//
// BUT THE FILLER THAT DILUTES IS ITSELF SPAM, and that is what closes it. Repetitive padding
// is flagged independently — an early probe produced a consequence for every padding message
// as well as the lure. So the attacker needs padding that is BOTH unpunished AND diluting,
// and measurement says they cannot have both:
//
//	5 varied natural messages, ~220 runes each   all clean 0.80-0.95, none punished
//	5 varied natural messages at the 400 cap     all clean 0.85, none punished
//	  ...and the windowed verdict on the lure:   spam 0.95, three runs of three
//
// 1,916 runes of free padding did not move the verdict at all. Dilution needed the repetitive
// text, and repetitive text is what gets caught on its own.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CLAIM. The obvious thing to write here is that §6's escalate-only
// rule saves the day, because the BARE pass reads no prior and so cannot be diluted. That is
// structurally true and it is asserted below as a floor. It is NOT what defends against this
// attack, and saying so would have been a guess dressed as a finding: deleting the bare pass
// entirely, and separately making the window's verdict win outright, both left the scanner
// still catching the diluted lure. The bare pass is a backstop that was not needed here.
//
// So: one assertion, and the rest logged. Model verdicts are judgement calls, and a test that
// fails because a 4B model said spam instead of scam teaches nothing.

// dilutionFiller is varied natural prose, because repetitive filler is itself flagged and
// would make the fixture measure the wrong thing.
