// THE MONIKER IS NOT MODERATED. MEASUREMENT SAYS LEAVE IT THAT WAY — AND SHOWS WHAT THAT COSTS.
//
// §8 says the moniker is "unowned and impersonatable by design". What it does not say, and what
// matters operationally, is that the scanner never SEES it: `Claim` selects id, chain, court,
// body, ip_hash and net_hash. A scam has two halves, a credibility claim and an ask, and only one
// of them is ever in the classifier's input.
//
// THE ASK IS THE HALF THAT MATTERS, mostly. What gets classified is the move-to-a-private-channel,
// which cannot be smuggled into a 24-rune name. Measured on the body alone:
//
//	"happy to help — message me privately and I will resolve your dispute"   spam 0.85  acted on
//	"DM me for help with your claim, I can look it up on my end"            scam 0.85  acted on
//	"I can restore your account access, contact me directly"                scam 0.25  DROPPED
//
// THE THIRD ONE IS THE HOLE, and it is worth being exact about where it goes rather than calling
// it caught. 0.25 is under MinConfidence, so the label becomes Unknown — and `sqlAwaitingReview`
// excludes `unknown`, so it earns no consequence AND no human look. It is the most
// authority-flavoured of the three and the one that disappears.
//
// FEEDING THE MONIKER IN WOULD MAKE THAT WORSE, WHICH IS THE REASON NOT TO. Same third body,
// twice, with a name prepended:
//
//	"[dave] I can restore your account access…"              scam 0.25 -> 0.85   acted on
//	"[kourt-moderator] I can restore your account access…"   scam 0.25 -> 0.25   still dropped
//
// gemma3:4b reads a claimed moderator restoring accounts as legitimate and "dave" doing the same
// thing as a scam. So the name is not merely uninformative to the model, it is a DISCOUNT on
// exactly the message an impersonator sends. Including it would hand that discount over.
//
// The false-positive arm was clean throughout, including "Kourt Support" asking an ordinary
// question and "sysadmin_jane" mentioning work, but that is not what decided it. The discount is.
//
// ASSERTED: the floor, and the paired positive. Model judgement is logged, not asserted — a
// fixture that fails because a 4B model said spam instead of scam teaches nothing, and the
// confidence numbers above are a measurement of one model, not a contract.

// WHERE A HEDGED VERDICT GOES: nowhere. Read from the rows rather than from the SQL, because the
// route is assembled from three separate decisions and none of them mentions the others.
//
//	scanner.go   a label under MinConfidence is rewritten to Unknown  ("a hedged verdict
//	             punishes nobody" — correct on its own)
//	store.go     sqlAwaitingReview excludes '', 'clean' AND 'unknown'  (correct on its own:
//	             a clean message is not a review item)
//	together     a suspicion the model half-believes is recorded, punishes nobody, and is
//	             shown to nobody
//
// This is the same composition shape as the outage in outage_test.go — two defensible rules whose
// product is a silence — and it is worth pinning as CURRENT behaviour rather than fixed on sight.
// Raising the bar's floor into the review queue would put every 0.25 hunch about a stranger in
// front of an operator, and §7's queue exists precisely so a person only sees what is worth their
// time. The right size of that trade-off is an operator's call, not a test's.
//
// So: asserted as it stands, and documented in §6. If somebody later decides hedged verdicts
// should reach a human, this fixture is the thing that has to change, and its comment says why.
