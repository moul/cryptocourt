//
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db list                 what is in force
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db list -all            including reversed decisions
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db why 42               the evidence behind one decision
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db unban 42             reverse it, and un-hide the messages
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db kick <ip-hash> -for 1h   a bounded, manual timeout
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db ban <ip-hash>        a permanent ban, by hand
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db ban -net <net-hash>  the same for a network
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db hash 203.0.113.7     the hashes for one address
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db review               what the scanner left for a human
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db kick -msg 41 -for 1h act on a message you just read
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db prune -older-than 720h   what 30-day retention would drop
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db freeze dev/bedford      stop serving a purged court
//	kourtchatctl -db chat.db status               backlog, scanner heartbeat, counts
//
// It takes HASHES, not addresses, and that is a consequence of hashing rather than
// an oversight: the addresses are not stored, so neither this tool nor anybody
// holding the database can turn a row back into a person. Read a hash off a `list`
// or `why`, or out of the 403 a caller reports.
//
// `hash` exists because that left a gap with no way out. Every hash had to be read
// off an EXISTING infraction, so an operator holding a fresh database and an address
// they can see in their own proxy logs — a reported harassment case, an address the
// classifier never flagged — had nothing to act on. It hashes FORWARD, which discloses
// nothing new: anyone who can run it already holds the key and the database, and
// CHAT.md §3 concedes that recovering every IPv4 address from those two is seconds of
// work. It refuses to MINT a key, because a mistyped --secret-file would otherwise
// yield a plausible hash under a brand-new key and a ban that matched nobody.
//
// `kick` exists for the same reason in the other direction. The automated half tops out
// at a bounded timeout precisely because proportionate and reversible is the design;
// leaving a human no manual option BUT a permanent ban made the most severe tool the
// only one. A manual kick is capped by nothing — clamping is for automated reasons —
// so `-for` is required rather than defaulted.

// choice for a quiet court sharing a GPU with other work — is then permanently "stale — is kourtmod
// running?" while running perfectly, and an operator chases a phantom. Measured: a six-minute-old
// heartbeat, healthy for that configuration, warned.
//
// Three cadences of silence is the bound. One is ordinary — the read can land just before the next
// write — and two is a single missed cycle, which a slow batch explains. Three is a pattern. Floored
// at a minute so the 5s default does not warn on fifteen seconds of nothing.
//
// A cadence of zero means the scanner did not say: an older row, or a caller with no interval. Then
// there is nothing to derive a bound from and the old five minutes is as good an answer as any,
// which is why it survives as the fallback rather than being deleted.
