// works whether or not the scanner is running and an OOM in a 7B model cannot take
// HTTP down with it.
//
//	kourtchat --db ./chat.db --chain dev=http://127.0.0.1:26657
//
// Behind a reverse proxy, and this matters more than any other flag:
//
//	kourtchat --behind-proxy --trusted-proxy 10.0.0.0/8 --country-header CF-IPCountry
//
// Without --behind-proxy the client address is the peer and X-Forwarded-For is
// ignored entirely, so a direct listener cannot be spoofed by sending the header.
// With it, the header is walked right to left and the first hop that is not a
// trusted proxy wins. Setting --behind-proxy with no trusted CIDR is refused: it
// would believe the header from anybody.

// keyWarning reports what is wrong with where the IP hashing key lives, or "" when nothing is.
//
// Three cases, and the first is the default:
//
//	no --secret-file        the key is a row IN the database, so one file carries the hashes
//	                        and the key that reverses them
//	same directory as it     a backup or rsync of that directory carries both, which is the
//	                        threat the hashing exists for
//	under that directory     the same thing. tar and rsync take subdirectories.
//
// THE THIRD CASE USED TO BE SILENT, and it is the one this deployment ships. Measured on the
// running server: --db /var/lib/kourt/chat.db --secret-file /var/lib/kourt/secret/iphash.key,
// with 0600 on both and no warning in thirty days of journal, because /var/lib/kourt/secret is
// not equal to /var/lib/kourt. A copy of /var/lib/kourt \u2014 the natural backup unit, and what a
// VPS snapshot takes \u2014 carries the table and the key that reverses it. CHAT.md \u00a79 states the
// rule as "outside the data directory" and gives /etc/kourt/ip.key as the example; equality is
// narrower than that sentence, so the check disagreed with its own documentation and the
// shipped layout sat in the gap.
//
// CONTAINMENT, NOT A PREFIX TEST, which is the trap this function already had a test for:
// strings.HasPrefix("/var/lib/kourt-backup", "/var/lib/kourt") is true and those are unrelated
// directories. filepath.Rel answers the real question \u2014 a path is under another when the route
// between them does not have to climb out first.

// way today, and the operator may have a reason. Being unable to see it is the problem.
