"""A small court, told as a story: the CI-sized scenario.

Deliberately does NOT answer a claim. Answering needs ~2,160 blocks of stake
history (answerWindow = 3 * epochBlocks) at ~103ms a block — about 3.7 minutes,
which is a fifth of the whole txtar budget for one file. Everything here runs
under ~30 seconds and still exercises the parts that only a real chain can
prove: the clock latch, real GNOT burned into court coin, staking, moderation,
folders, and — the point of the test clock — a deadline crossed by moving the
date rather than by waiting for it.

The seeded demo (a longer scenario, run by hand) is where answering, settling
and opening the rewards belong, because there the 3.7 minutes buys real conviction.

# possessive into broken tokens. Eight of the demo's own titles have one, so
# this claim keeps the -args and stdout paths honest on every run.
#
# It does NOT cover the third path, a qeval ARGUMENT carrying free text: this
# assertion passes an integer id. An audit found that path was the one still
# unquoted, and it now shares the same _q_txtar as the other two; no read in the
