"""A claim walked all the way to a verdict, on a real chain.

CI = False. This scenario mines its way past `answerWindow`, which is 2,160
blocks (answer.gno:15, `3 * epochBlocks`), and at the measured ~525ms a block
that is around twenty minutes. Round 4 ruled CI scenarios stay under ~200
blocks, so this one never becomes a txtar; it exists to seed a node by hand:

    scripts/seed-node.sh scenarios/deep.py
    python3 scripts/check-live-reads.py --remote http://127.0.0.1:26657

WHY IT IS WORTH TWENTY MINUTES. Every state past "open" has never once been
exercised against a live chain. The smoke scenario reaches open, staked, hidden
and dead-closed; the conformance harness then SKIPS seven reads — AnswerVerdict,
Answerer, AnswerBond, Verdict, VerdictRoute, QuorumFloorOf, DrawSlices —
because their guards are false, which means the page's answered and settled
paths have no live evidence behind them at all. Two live-node runs have already
found defects no unit test did (sealing erased the clock disclosure; the curve's
integer price rendered a court's coin as free), and both were in exactly this
kind of untested seam.

WHAT IT TAKES TO ANSWER A CLAIM, read from the realm rather than guessed:

  * `PostAnswer` demands a MATURE trailing average (answer.gno:47-50). Maturity
    is `count == want && filled >= want` (twap.gno:243) with
    `want = answerWindow / epochBlocks = 2160 / 720 = 3`. So the claim's ring
    needs observations spanning three 720-block buckets.
  * `Observe` carries the last value forward across skipped buckets and counts
    each step, so two stakes far enough apart fill the ring — you do not need
    three separate transactions, you need three buckets of HEIGHT.
  * The trailing average must also clear `effMinAnswerX`, so the stake has to be
    substantial relative to the court's supply.
  * Settling is wall-clock gated (session.gno:32, 72h), which the test clock
    crosses for free — that is the whole point of the clock, and it is why this
    scenario costs twenty minutes and not three days.
