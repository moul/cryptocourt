"""A dispute opened, voted and RESOLVED — with no blocks mined.

The most expensive gate in the realm. A dispute vote closes on HEIGHT:
`votingBlocks` is 120,960 (court.gno, one week at 5s a block), plus
`graceBlocks`. Before the height override, resolving one meant producing
138,240 blocks — measured at ~2 blocks per transaction and ~75 transactions a
minute, that is upwards of FIFTEEN HOURS. It is now two transactions.

This is the scenario the whole height override was for. `OpenRewards` (see
crystal.py) proved the realm's own gates move; this proves the PURE PACKAGES
move with them, which is the harder half: `p/governor` decides when a vote is
still "active" and `p/grc20votes` decides which epoch a vote weighs at, and
neither may import a realm. They read the height through the injected
`Electorate.Height()` — so if that injection were wrong, everything else could
fast-forward and a dispute would still sit open for ever.

QUORUM IS THE REASON THERE ARE FIVE BUYERS. `QuorumFloorOf` takes a max()
against 5% of supply, and a round that misses it FAILS rather than deciding —
which would look exactly like the height override not working. The stake is
sized so the cast weight clears the floor.

#      elapsed, so a reservoir is still zero the instant it rolls.
# Hence: cross one boundary, touch, cross into the next, touch again.
# `Buy` is the touch: staking freezes once a claim has an answer (learned by
