"""A claim walked to a rewardsOpened draw — with no blocks mined at all.

This file is the height override's receipt. It used to be `CI = False` and cost
roughly two hours, because `OpenRewards` is barred until block 17,280
(openrewards.gno, `priorityWindowBlocks`) and the only way to a block was to
produce one. It now runs in the ordinary suite, because the chain will happily
be TOLD the height.

WHAT EACH WAIT ACTUALLY IS, read from the realm rather than guessed:

  answerWindow          2,160 blocks  (answer.gno: 3 x epochBlocks) — the
                        trailing average must be mature before an answer.
  settleSecs               72 hours   (clock.gno) — wall-clock, so the calendar
                        half of the override handles it.
  priorityWindowBlocks 17,280 blocks  (court.gno, 24h) — the quiet window after
                        the last flag event; `lastFlagEventAt` is 0 on a claim
                        nobody flagged, so the gate reads `now < 17_280` in
                        ABSOLUTE height.

Total: ~19,440 blocks and three days, in about a dozen transactions.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM. The draw comes out ZERO on every slice, and that is
correct rather than a defect: `want` is clamped to `c.curPeriodBudget`
(openrewards.gno), which stays zero until a court's first `rollPeriod` at
`createdAt + periodBlocks` — 120,960 blocks. Advancing that far is now cheap
too, but a court with one claim has nothing to emit against, so a non-zero draw
needs a fuller scenario than this one. Stated here so a zero is read as the
chain's answer and not as a broken seed.

# THIS TESTED THE 24h QUIET WINDOW, which the realm deleted on purpose, and the

# window read lastFlagEventAt, the quality lane was the only thing that ever
# stamped it, and with that lane gone the field is zero on every claim, leaving
# "a check that can only fire in the first day of a chain's life". This file
# went on asserting a refusal the realm had stopped making.
#
# What survives on OpenRewards is the week it stays participant-only, so the
# assertion moves there rather than being dropped — the shape of the old test
# was right and its subject had gone.
#
# DEPLOYER is the stranger: alice authored the claim and staked it, bob staked
# it and answered, so isParticipant is true for both and this gate can never
# refuse either of them, at any time.
