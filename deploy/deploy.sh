# There are two things to deploy and they are unrelated to each other:
#
#   the overlay   web/index.html — ONE self-contained static file. No build, no
#                 bundler, no assets directory: it is a copy into a webroot.
#   the chat      cmd/kourtchat — a Go service with a SQLite database. It never
#                 talks to the model (the scanner is a separate process that
#                 wants a GPU; this does not), so it is at home on the same
#                 ordinary box as the static file.
#
# The realm is NOT deployed from here. It goes to a gno chain with gnokey, and
# the overlay reads whichever chain you point it at.
#
# NOT COPIED, EVER: the database, the IP-hashing key, and anything else under
# /var/lib/kourt. The database is the service's whole memory and the key
# reverses its address hashes; both belong only on the server. This script
# creates the paths and then keeps its hands off them.

#
# THE CITY FILE FIRST, THE COUNTRY FILE AS THE FALLBACK. The presence map places
# a reader in a coarse ~550km cell rather than naming only their country, and
# the coordinates for that come from db-ip's city-lite file. kourtchat sniffs
# which of the two it has been given — see geo.Load — so this step's only job is
# to land the better one when it can and the older one when it cannot.
#
# STORED GZIPPED, AND THAT IS NOT tidiness. MEASURED: city-lite is 82MB
# compressed and 658MB expanded. Expanding it onto a box this file elsewhere
# notes as having 1.1GB free, to save three seconds of startup, is a bad trade —
# so it is kept as downloaded and read through a decompressor.
#
# AND THE DISK IS CHECKED BEFORE THE DOWNLOAD, because the failure this avoids
# is not a missing map. It is a full disk on a live box, which takes the chain
# node and the chat database with it. If there is not comfortable room the step
# asks for the country file instead and says so.
#
# NOTHING HERE MAY FAIL THE DEPLOY. Flags are decoration and kourtchat already
# logs and carries on with no file at all, so every step below is best-effort:
# db-ip.com being down must not stop a code deploy.
#
# AND A BAD DOWNLOAD MUST NOT REPLACE A GOOD FILE. The failure mode is not a
# missing file, it is an HTML error page or a truncated transfer landing at the
# path kourtchat reads — which would parse to a handful of spans and quietly give
# the whole internet no country. So the candidate is checked before the rename:
# it must have at least 100,000 rows and its first row must start with a digit.

# exec'd was open-for-write by another process — execve returns ETXTBSY, and

# restart counter had reached 6.) A per-deploy suffix means B's upload can never
# be the file A renames, whatever the timing; $LOCK below stops the two from
# interleaving their renames and restarts on top of that. Two mechanisms because
# they answer different halves — the suffix makes the collision impossible, the
